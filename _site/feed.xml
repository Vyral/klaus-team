        <title>Business Spotlight: Just-In Time Moving and Storage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTy1a8hSRqI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves.&lt;/strong&gt; So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.%20http://localhost:4000/business-spotlight-just-in-time-moving-and-storage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that &lt;strong&gt;Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve got moving or storage needs Justin and his team can help with, give Just-In Time Moving and Storage a call at (480) 213-0395 or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://.jitmoving.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.jitmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as always, if you have any other questions for us at the Klaus Team, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Going On in Our Arizona Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbgVUV3aUog?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for another market update, and we’ve seen some interesting changes since the last time we examined local real estate trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as you may already know, our overall Arizona market has been very strong in 2018 with respect to appreciation and sales. However, &lt;strong&gt;as predicted, rising interest rates have now caused an increase in inventory—and this has led to a slight slowdown in our market.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, this change simply means that sellers will need to be especially cognizant of their pricing strategies. And buyers, too, can reap certain advantages by making their move in today’s market. For instance, even though interest rates have increased, they are still historically low. This means buyers still have the opportunity to lock in a favorable rate before the Fed makes even more increases—as is expected to be the case as we head into 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-going-on-in-our-arizona-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is that our market is beginning to balance out.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve been in a seller’s market for some time, but conditions have started to level off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there’s a lot happening in our Arizona right now. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you, and our team would be happy to help you with any of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t ready to make a move immediately, we would still like to help you stay informed. We offer a number of great events, and we highly encourage you to come out and expand your knowledge of real estate. &lt;strong&gt;You can find more information about our team and the events we offer by visiting our website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klausteam.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.klausteam.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don’t Miss Our Next Homeowner Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFSRdF7y0r8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent homeowner workshops have been massively successful, and it’s been very interesting to see the responses of those who have attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tips on preparing homes for the market, in particular, have been extremely well-received. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re curious about buying or selling, or simply want to better understand our market, I would highly encourage you to check out our next workshop.&lt;/strong&gt; You will learn which upgrades and repairs bring the greatest return on investment, as well as a number of other things you can do to boost your chance of success in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you have already attended one of these events, I would still encourage you to join us again. In addition to covering some of the basic information I mentioned earlier, we will also be covering current market trends. Our goal is to keep you informed as our market develops, so that you can be successful with your own buying or selling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We want to help you stay educated and up-to-date on all things related to local real estate.%20http://localhost:4000/dont-miss-our-next-homeowner-workshop.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We want to help you stay educated and up-to-date on all things related to local real estate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of conflicting information out there about our market and about real estate in general. These workshops are designed to help you separate fact from fiction. We want to help you stay educated and up-to-date on all things related to local real estate. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re interested in attending our next workshop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-kenny-klaus-team-3350101698&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
