        <title>Highlights From Our Client Appreciation Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Klaus Team celebrates our clients and their families by renting out a theatre at the Harkins Superstition 25 movie theatre. The movie shown this year was “Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet”, it’s no surprise why the movie is #1 in the box office! The room was filled with laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santa stopped by to visit with the children and take family photos, which was a bit hit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some help from our vendors and business partners, the Klaus Team awarded our clients with gift cards, gift baskets and other prizes through a raffle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached are some photos from the event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are We in a Real Estate Bubble?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eyJk8H-ihb8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we in a real estate bubble? I’m here to answer this question today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are certainly seeing changes in the market right now and things are shifting.&lt;/strong&gt; We saw interest rates increase several times this year, and we may see them increase three more times in 2019. However, let’s keep things in perspective. Right now, rates are right around 5% on average. From 2009 to 2011, they were over 6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, the housing market has continued to be solid.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re seeing a bit of a slowdown, to be sure, and a slight decrease in home appreciation. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however. There are still more people moving here than there are moving away. Things are changing, but we’re definitely not in a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We should continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.%20http://localhost:4000/are-we-in-a-real-estate-bubble.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We should continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on some programs with our lenders and sellers to offer a bit of an incentive to still get people qualified for a home affordably. We’re always at the forefront of this and looking out for the best interests of our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re still in a very good market and hope to continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I wanted to note is that if you’re currently moving or considering a move and you need to donate some things, the Salvation Army has a great program where they’ll come and pick up everything and donate it to a great cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always give more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clients are the source of everything I do. Always giving more and providing value through creating lasting relationships. It is an honor when clients become friends. I pride myself in being authentic by giving you the good, the bad, and ugly news with solutions through the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A house is a large investment that becomes a home with endless memories. Your time and goals are always a focus for me. As a professional, my role is to understand and study your interests to be in the strongest negotiating position possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a transplant to Arizona coming from South Dakota and Oregon, I appreciate the sun and the unique beautiful scenery it has to offer year-round. My background is in executive operations in senior living administration with a Bachelor’s Degree in Healthcare Business Administration from Oregon State University. That experience provides an understanding of unique business acumen and how to best support your goals with creativity. Outside of my real estate passion, I enjoy experiencing the world with my husband, Eric. In my off-time, I volunteer with the Ronald McDonald House Central and Northern Arizona Charities and local non-profits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Business Spotlight: Just-In Time Moving and Storage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTy1a8hSRqI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves.&lt;/strong&gt; So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.%20http://localhost:4000/business-spotlight-just-in-time-moving-and-storage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that &lt;strong&gt;Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve got moving or storage needs Justin and his team can help with, give Just-In Time Moving and Storage a call at (480) 213-0395 or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://.jitmoving.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.jitmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as always, if you have any other questions for us at the Klaus Team, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Going On in Our Arizona Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbgVUV3aUog?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for another market update, and we’ve seen some interesting changes since the last time we examined local real estate trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as you may already know, our overall Arizona market has been very strong in 2018 with respect to appreciation and sales. However, &lt;strong&gt;as predicted, rising interest rates have now caused an increase in inventory—and this has led to a slight slowdown in our market.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, this change simply means that sellers will need to be especially cognizant of their pricing strategies. And buyers, too, can reap certain advantages by making their move in today’s market. For instance, even though interest rates have increased, they are still historically low. This means buyers still have the opportunity to lock in a favorable rate before the Fed makes even more increases—as is expected to be the case as we head into 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-going-on-in-our-arizona-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is that our market is beginning to balance out.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve been in a seller’s market for some time, but conditions have started to level off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there’s a lot happening in our Arizona right now. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you, and our team would be happy to help you with any of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t ready to make a move immediately, we would still like to help you stay informed. We offer a number of great events, and we highly encourage you to come out and expand your knowledge of real estate. &lt;strong&gt;You can find more information about our team and the events we offer by visiting our website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klausteam.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.klausteam.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFSRdF7y0r8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent homeowner workshops have been massively successful, and it’s been very interesting to see the responses of those who have attended.&lt;/p&gt;
