        <title>What’s Happening in Our October Market?</title>

        <description>

There’s plenty of noise out there about our current real estate market. So today we wanted to cut through it and share what’s truly happening in our local market.

The good news is that we’re still seeing a very healthy market overall. The market continues to favor sellers, but it’s beginning to slow down somewhat. The end of March and early April was the peak of the multiple offers and bidding war chaos. That’s still happening, but not as much as it was before.

Interest rates remain low, and we anticipate they’ll stay that way through this year and hopefully into the next. However, with the way the world is these days, you never know what changes may happen. The top five real estate economists have predicted that within the next five years, we should see a gradual downturn in appreciation. We predict to see somewhere in the mid-fours and upper-threes within the next five years. In my opinion, that’s great news because the housing market is stable. You should also know that mortgage payments are very affordable compared to rents in this market.

Additionally, we have an array of people moving here because of the large companies coming here to the East Valley. There’s a new Facebook data center, Apple, Gateway, the Legacy sports complex, and more. They’re bringing more jobs, which brings more people. I think we’ll continue to see an excellent market in Phoenix.

“We’re still seeing a very healthy market overall.”

If you’ve considered buying a second property, a slew of people are sitting on quite a bit of equity today, which is money just sitting there not working for you. The investment market is very strong at the moment; we’re undersupplied on rentals.

We’re here every day working hard and ensuring we’re keeping up with the latest technologies and tools to best serve you. We appreciate your continued support and referrals; they’re the lifeblood of our business.

We know there’s a bunch of information and programs out there, so if you have questions about them or anything having to do with real estate, call us first. We work with those programs and can guide you through all your different options and help you decide what’s best for yourself and your family.

In our continuing effort to bring value to the trusted people in our network and to help you stay on top of everything that’s happening in our market, we’ve started a podcast called the State 48 Homeowner Podcast.

There, you can not only find out what’s going on in the real estate industry at large but also get home maintenance tips, advice about mortgages, and information about how to maintain your home’s value for the future. You can scroll through our database of shows and pick one that strikes your interest. Feel free to share with your friends and family, too!

The market is always changing, but the media that report on it are often weeks or months behind what’s going on in real-time, so the State 48 Homeowner Podcast is just one way to stay on top of all things real estate.

Check it out when you get a chance! And if you ever have any questions or ideas for topics that we could address in our podcast, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. We’ll always give you our professional advice and put your best interest at heart.

Today’s message is brief but important: We’re here for you. There’s a lot going on in the market, in the media, and the world at large. If you see something strange in the news, have any questions about the market, or just want to better understand a concept related to real estate, we can help.

        <description>

Happy St. Patrick’s Day! Today I’m just sharing some quick information. 

You may have heard how crazy our market currently is due to low inventory. Buyers are having a difficult time finding new homes because there are multiple offers on most properties. Our team has helped over 40 buyers get under contract already this year. There’s no luck involved—it’s pure skill. We’ve been doing this for over 20 years; we have strategies and tools that help our client’s offers stand out from the rest and help them win.

“Our team has helped over 40 buyers get under contract already this year.”

If you have a house to sell and you’re concerned that you won’t find one to buy, our Buy First and Sell program is the right tool for you. We’ve had dozens of clients take advantage of this program; you don’t sacrifice your equity. You move into your new property first, prepare your other home for sale, list it, and then get top dollar. 

Give us a call or send an email for more details about how we can help you buy or sell or if you have any questions. We’d love to provide a free consultation with no hassle or obligation. Enjoy St. Patrick’s Day!

It’s Super Bowl week! However, there’s a more important game going on out there—the real estate game. We want to make sure you’re receiving your real estate information from a good, reliable source. There’s so much going on in the market: low inventory, low interest rates, and tons of talk and noise. We’re always here to be your trusted resource in real estate. 

We’re here in the trenches every day conducting business, and people are still buying and selling real estate. We have excellent strategies to help buyers get into their new homes; we win more contracts than the average real estate agent. We also have strategies to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible for our sellers. 

“We’re always here as your trusted source in real estate.”

If you’re considering taking advantage of the current market but are worried about finding a new house because of the low inventory—you’d be surprised. Properties come up for sale all the time, but you need to be in a position to jump when the right one appears. We have a Buy First, Then Sell program where you won’t have to give up your equity; we’ll find your new home first, secure it, move in, then prepare your first house for the market. We also have a Sell and Stay program as well as Lease Purchase programs for those who are trying to get into the market but can’t quite purchase yet. 

Don’t ever hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email if you have questions about buying, selling, or anything else. Also, contact us if you want an update on your home’s current market value straight from us—not from some iffy online site. Additionally, we always have home service referrals for when you need something done in your house. Enjoy the Super Bowl!

        <description>

Our current real estate market is unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my 21 years in the business. Inventory is at an all-time low, so if you’re thinking of selling or would like to know what your home is worth, you’d be surprised at what price you can fetch. Get in touch with us and we’d be happy to give you a true home valuation. 

If you’re thinking of selling and buying but are afraid to do so because inventory is so low, I have great news: Now that we’re into 2021, we have more programs than we’ve ever had that allow you to pull off these simultaneous transactions. I truly wish we had some of these programs in the past to make the process of buying and selling real estate easier. We realize that not everyone fits into the same category—we have programs for those looking to buy and sell at the same time, sell and then stay in their home to release some of their equity, lease their next property so they can buy it within the next five years, etc. 

With interest rates as low as they are, buyer demand is high, so we’d love to have a quick conversation with you to outline your options. As always, you’re under no obligation; we’re here to serve you. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

On behalf of the entire Klaus Team, I wish you happy holidays! Once again, thank you all for an amazing year. Despite all the chaos going on in our world, the real estate market has remained very steady, anchored by low interest rates and low inventory. We’re grateful for this resilient market, and we’re excited to be turning our attention toward making the holidays brighter for a few families in our community. 

We are heading into the fifth year with our charity, Klaus Team Cares. For every person you refer and every home you buy or sell with us, we take a portion of that commission and donate it back to Klaus Team Cares, allowing us to then give back directly to local communities. This year we’re serving 24 families (84 total kids) that were brought to our attention as needing some assistance for Christmas. 

We commissioned a group to do all of the shopping for these families, and we held a wrapping party last Saturday. We’re ready to make this holiday season special for our neighbors who are experiencing hardship in these especially trying times. Our effort to give back is merely an outpouring of our deep appreciation; we’re so thankful for your continued support and your referrals, which allow us to do so much good here in the local community. 

“This year we’re serving 24 families (84 total kids) that were brought to our attention as needing some assistance for Christmas.”

For those of you who receive our local newsletter, you’ll be able to read about some additional ways that you can help us support our community. For example, you’re always welcome to drop off your nonperishable food donations at our office, Monday through Friday, and we’ll be sure to get it to our partners at the United Food Bank. Also, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Wednesday this month, we’ll be at the Fry’s in Guadalupe and Signal Butte ringing bells for the Salvation Army. On Wednesday, December 9, the Klaus Team Cares charity will match any donation that is made to the Salvation Army. Stop by and drop your donation in one of the kettles, or donate by visiting klausteamcares.org. 

Again, thank you for all that you do for us here at the Klaus Team. 2020 hasn’t been an easy year for most of us, but it’s inspiring to see everyone pull together. People still need to buy and sell homes in our area, and we’re proud to serve not only them, but their friends and family as well. We look forward to an amazing 2021.

We have more specialized programs now than we’ve ever had before, including Buy First Then Sell, which has opened up possibilities for so many families. It allows you to buy and move into your new home first, then get your old home ready for market and sell for top dollar. 

If you’re interested in learning more about any of the Klaus Team’s game-changing solutions for buying or selling in today’s market, please reach out via phone or email. We’re always here to be of service, and we look forward to hearing from you. Stay safe, and have a fantastic holiday season!

Did you know that 83% of the average American’s wealth at retirement comes from home equity and not other investments? This means that making smart home finance decisions over the life cycle of homeownership is the key to building long-term wealth. How can you ensure you’re making the right decisions at the right time? Allow us to introduce you to Homebot, a personalized dashboard that helps homeowners build wealth by making smart and timely home finance decisions. 

Every month, Homebot automatically sends you an easy-to-read home overview that tracks your home value, loans, equity, and your local real estate market conditions. It provides information like when to remodel, refinance, buy, and sell. It’s like a report card for your house. Homebot even helps you calculate the financial impact of converting a property into a short-term rental on Airbnb.

“Every month, Homebot automatically sends you an easy-to-read home overview.”

U.S. homeowners leave over $100 billion of wealth on the table each year by making poor home finance decisions. The constant fluctuation of real estate markets makes these decisions challenging. That’s why Homebot makes decisions simple, customizing the experience to your market and situation. It empowers you with the knowledge you need to build wealth. 

Thanks to the Klaus Team, Homebot is 100% free to homeowners! You can even share it with your friends, family, and social sphere. 

If you have any questions about Homebot or real estate in general, call or email us. We at the Klaus Team would love to help with whatever you need.

Do you want to create long-term memories in a home, but aren’t ready to purchase yet? We at the Klaus Team are excited to introduce our Lease to Own program, a new way to rent first then buy. Here’s how it works: First, we help you qualify for the right program; we have multiple solutions with flexible income and credit requirements to accommodate your specific situation. Next, you’ll choose a new home you love that’s listed for sale (most single-family homes and townhomes qualify), and our partner will purchase the property on your behalf. 

Once the purchase is completed, you move in as a tenant and begin paying rent; you can lease anywhere from two to five years. In some cases, a percentage of rent goes toward your down payment. Finally, you may choose to buy the home during your lease term, or, you can simply walk away at the end of the lease.  When you choose to purchase, you begin building equity and wealth. We have more solutions than ever before to help people transition into a new living space. Reach out to us today by phone or email and we’ll get you started on the path that’s best for you!

Here at the Klaus Team, we’re proud to introduce our Buy Then Sell program, a new way to buy a house before selling your old one. Here’s how it works: First, we get you approved for a home loan so you can make a stronger offer on the house you love. We’ll even lend you the down payment on your new home; that means no worrying about having equity tied up in your old house. 

Once you’ve purchased your new home, we advance you up to six months of mortgage payments on the old house so you’ll never have to pay two mortgages at the same time.  Finally, we offer you up to $25,000 in prepaid home prep funds so you can sell your old house for top dollar. With a dedicated support team, we’re there for you every step of the way to ensure your house sells as quickly as possible. We’ve spent a lot of time improving the real estate experience to give you more certainty, convenience, and cost savings, and we believe that’s what makes our Buy Then Sell program the best possible way to buy and sell a home. 

Find out more by contacting a Klaus Team agent by phone, email, or visiting our website. We’d be more than happy to answer your questions and get you on the path to a smooth transaction.

        <description>

We’re excited to announce our new Lease to Own program available now. This unique option has an approximate 85% success rate for clients to transition from the lease purchase to ownership; the typical industry has only seen about a 5% success rate over the years, which is far from a win-win for the potential tenant/buyer. 

What’s awesome about our program is that it allows you to go out and look at homes just like a homebuyer. Then our partners step in and buy the property you’ve identified at today’s rates and prices; the great news here is that they’re assumable loans, so whether it takes one, three, or five years for you to qualify for a full purchase of that property, you’ll still lock in today’s rates and assume the equity position that’s been built up. When you do take ownership, you’ll just pay 1% over that equity. 

“Reach out for a no-hassle consultation to see if this is a good fit for you or your loved ones.”

This could be a great opportunity for someone who’s currently paying off someone else’s mortgage in the form of demoralizing rent payments. If you’re a parent who has kids who are renting at the moment, this program could be a wonderful first step for them. We’d be more than happy to set up a consultation and explain how their living expenses can start working for them. Follow the links on this blog and contact us right away for more information. 

Why not reach out for a no-hassle consultation to see if this is a good fit for you or your loved ones? Being a homeowner is a great feeling, and that’s why we want to leverage all of our tools and expertise to provide folks with a path toward homeownership. 

As always, we appreciate you; your referrals mean the world to us—please keep them coming! If ever you have questions regarding housing market trends, financing options, or any other real estate-related topic, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We’re here to assist you!

Are you thinking about making a move, but overwhelmed because your current home has recently become a classroom, gym, and office space? We understand the struggles of trying to find the right home while you worry about selling your current one in these unusual times. Many folks trust that selling their home will be easy but fear what may happen if they can’t find their next home. We here at The Klaus Team have never left anyone homeless, and we won’t start with you. 

We’re excited to announce our Buy Then Sell program. This exclusive, limited-time opportunity allows you to buy your new home first, move into it, and then get your old home ready to go on the market—all while avoiding double payments. In this environment, it’s in your best interest to not occupy your property while showings occur, which means this program is ideal. Having a vacant, move-in ready home to show buyers also increases your odds of netting more money in the sale. 

“As your real estate professionals, we keep adapting to make sure we bring you the best tools available on the market.”

We’d love to share more about this amazing program with you, so feel free to contact us for a no-hassle consultation to see if it’s a good fit. Several of our clients and their friends have already taken advantage of this. With today’s crazy low interest rates, it’s a great time to upgrade into a more accommodating property; perhaps it’s time to find a home with a space that can be your dedicated ‘Zoom room,’ or one with a larger backyard or in-ground pool. 

Click here for more information on our Buy Then Sell program. Don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email our way; let’s schedule a brief, one-on-one video call to explore how this program could help you achieve your real estate goals. We’re always here to help, and we’d love to hear from you soon!

It’s hot out there, and I’m not just talking about the weather. 

We’ve had an interesting past few months, to say the least, but the real estate market has stayed consistent and we’re seeing a lot of multiple-offer situations arise from the homes we’re listing lately. If you’re thinking of selling, now’s a great time to capture the equity you’ve built in your home. If you’re a buyer, you may face some challenges due to said multiple-offer situations and contingency-related issues. 

The great news is that, though real estate has been done the same way for the last 100 years, The Klaus Team now has even more options for buyers and sellers. Not only do we have programs to help sellers get their home ready for the market, but we have some great lease-purchase programs for buyers. For example, we have a new program that allows you to shop for homes and, after you’ve found the one you want, a company will buy it for you and allow you to lease it back. 

“Not everyone fits into the same program, so we’d be happy to schedule you a no-hassle consultation so you understand your options.”

If you need to buy and sell at the same time, we have another program we’re getting ready to release that provides you the financing to buy your next home while owning your current one. After you’ve made your purchase, we’ll get your original home ready for the market so you can get full retail price for it. Putting their home on the market without knowing whether the home they want next will be out there waiting for them is a big fear among home sellers, but this program solves that concern. 

The point is, we’re always adapting to the market. Not everyone fits into the same program, so we’d be happy to schedule you a no-hassle consultation so you understand your options. With the advances in technology and the amount of venture capital money out there, it’s created some unique buying and selling scenarios. If you’re thinking of investing, there’s a real shortage of rental properties out there. 

For many people, it’s all a matter of taking a few minutes out of their day and educating themselves. You might be surprised at what’s actually available. Similarly, the referrals you and many others send us allow us to focus on getting better educated as professionals instead of chasing internet leads. 

We look forward to the opportunity to help you learn all the different ways to buy and sell real estate in today’s market. We’re very competitive as a team, and it’s always our top priority to help our clients win. 

If you’d like to start your home buying or selling journey or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.

If you’re wondering how our Arizona real estate market is doing, I have good news: After a bit of a lull, things are starting to pick up again. 

Despite everything that’s happened since the COVID-19 lockdown, we’ve seen an increase in activity (much of which has been driven by historically low interest rates) and continue to see home values appreciate, much of which has been driven by historically low interest rates. 

This situation reminds some people of the housing market crash of 2008 and 2009, but there are a few key statistics that illustrate the difference between now and then. First of all, 58.7% of all homes in America have at least 60% equity—the growth of home prices nationwide has helped the market stay stable. Secondly, 42% of all homes are owned free and clear, which means those homeowners don’t have to sell no matter what happens to the market. 

“We’ve seen an increase in activity and continue to see home values appreciate.”

Also, the average equity in mortgaged homes is $177,000. Back in 2008, homeowners could take out almost 100% of their equity, which means if there was even the slightest market shift, they’d end up in the negative. Currently, we’re seeing people sitting on almost $200,000 worth of equity. Basically, tighter lending guidelines have helped homeowners because they can’t take out as much equity. 

That being said, sitting on that kind of equity means that money’s not working for you. If you’re curious about unleashing some of your equity and using it to buy a second home, I can tell you that many people build wealth through real estate. It almost sounds illegal—you can get a loan in the neighborhood of 20% down to pay off your mortgage—but it’s real, and many investors do it. Knowledge is power, and the opportunity to understand your investment options is critical in building long-term wealth and earning financial freedom and stability. 

If you’d like to learn more about investing in real estate or have any questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

Now that we’re feeling the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, where is our real estate market headed from here? A lot of people are drawing comparisons to the Great Recession of 2008 and assume a housing crisis is imminent, but the facts say otherwise. For one thing, mortgage standards have changed for the better since 2008, and rent prices have increased significantly since then. While it’s true that we’re in the middle of a slowdown, we expect to finish 2020 on a strong note.

If you have any real estate-related questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

I hope you’re all staying safe as we get through this historic time. I have a few upcoming events to share. First, we’re holding a town hall Zoom meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Our town councilman Kevin Thompson will be there, and we’ll be discussing what’s happening economically in the Southeast Valley: what’s new, changing, and coming. We’ll also be talking about the real estate market. To learn about our other upcoming events, watch the short video above.

We’ve been blessed to be able to serve you and your real estate needs for the past two-plus decades, and today we’re excited to announce another addition to the experience we deliver: A partnership with Hub Home Services.

Hub Home Services is a licensed contractor located right here in the East Valley that can take care of pretty much everything your home might need.  Painting, flooring, remodeling—they can help with it all. They just launched their app that you can download and explore today.

“All of this info will be stored in the app for you to access later.”

For example, you can take a picture of what’s broken in your home, get estimates, and schedule an appointment to get it fixed. All of this info will be stored in the app for you to access later.

This partnership is going to make homeownership that much easier for our clients. If you have any questions about Hub Home Services, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Considering selling your home this year? The market will be extremely busy because interest rates are staying low. We would like you to call us before making any upgrades or repairs to your house, as we’ve seen plenty of properties and can help you make the best decision about where to spend the money to get the best return for your investment. 

We want you to get as much as you possibly can out of your home. For most of us, it’s our biggest investment. We can help guide you whether it’s with flooring, countertops, hardware, fixtures, and so on. It’s not always as bad as you think. 

“When you work with us, we’re on your team; we guide you through the entire process.”

If you need help unlocking some of the equity in your home to do any repairs, we have options for you. Most of you have likely heard about the instant offer programs out there, but when you work with us, we’re on your team; we guide you through the entire process. If you’re considering selling in 2020, contact us. There’s no obligation, we’ll simply guide you through all of your options. 

If you’re thinking of selling, but not this year, it’s never too early to call or email us so we can discuss how you can begin preparing. If you have further questions, reach out to us. We look forward to serving you in 2020 and beyond.

        <description>

Several months ago, I was having lunch with a friend when our conversation headed to the same place most of my conversations end up: real estate. I found out that one item on their bucket list was to own an investment property. 

This was interesting to me because I remember buying my first investment property. Having someone else pay off your mortgage while you gain equity and cash flow is truly a financial marvel. As we continued to talk, I found out that they were able to buy a property sooner than they thought. 

“The Klaus Team will soon offer a real estate investment class to show you what it would be like to become an investor.”

The next thing you know, we put all the pieces of the puzzle together and found them an investment property. Now that they own one property, they’re thinking about buying another. 

I’m sharing this story because buying an investment property and building wealth through real estate is a great opportunity for you as well. On that note, the Klaus Team will soon offer a real estate investment class to show you what it would be like to become an investor. There are several financing options to get started that don’t involve pulling cash out of your savings account. 

We’re very excited about the prospect of helping you build wealth through real estate, so if you’d like to know more about this upcoming class or have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

2019 was an amazing year for the real estate market, and 2020 is primed to outpace it. Demand is high, supply is low (as are interest rates), and it’s an election year. Statistics show that roughly 681,000 people moved out of California last year, and many of them ended up here in Arizona.

Whether you’re thinking of buying or selling, we’d love it if you gave us a call. If you’re thinking of purchasing an investment property, feel free to schedule a no-obligation consultation with us as well, because that market is even busier than the regular market. 

“We have every service you need under one roof.”

There is a lot of marketing happening out there with iBuyers like Zillow, Offerpad, and OpenDoor, but if you decide to sell to one of these companies, let us help you do so; we can walk you through all of your options so that your identity is protected. We’ll represent you throughout the entire process, and it won’t cost you a thing. More importantly, we’ll provide you with a go-to-market value for your home and offer refinancing programs if you’re looking to unlock some equity. 

The bottom line is, we have every service you need under one roof. We look forward to helping you in 2020 and beyond.

If you’re confused about selling your home in today’s market, don’t worry—real estate can be confusing for even the most experienced agents. 

As a real estate professional, however, I spend my days researching all the options available for my clients. This helps me discover effective solutions for any and all of your buying or selling needs. 

“We protect your identity throughout the process and prevent your information from being sold.”

When our team is researching your home, we find out what it’s worth through many different avenues. We see what your property could sell for through companies like OpenDoor, and we aggregate your options so you can see exactly what you’re being offered. We protect your identity throughout the process and prevent your information from being sold.

After gathering the data, we present you with a side-by-side comparison of all of your available options. From there, you can decide which one fits best with your situation. Regardless of which you choose, we’re here to represent you throughout the entire process.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Trends in our market have been favorable overall in 2019, and we expect that to continue throughout 2020 and beyond for multiple reasons:


  Inventory is still low, so sellers are finding some great opportunities and a nice appreciation rate.
  There are still properties out there for buyers.
  Interest rates are very low, meaning home affordability is up.
  Due to rising rents, the market is stable. People won’t soon walk away from their properties like they did back in 2008.


These are all great signals for the real estate market to come. If you are currently renting, you might be able to get a home for less per month than you’re paying for rent. On the flip side, if you have some equity in your current home and are thinking about remodeling or refinancing, give us a call. We’ll help guide you through all your wealth-building options.

We’d love for your help this year as Klaus Team Cares works to provide children’s gifts for the Holidays. These kids are in our own backyard and need help.

I’m so excited that Netflix finally got the spelling and pronunciation right in my name for their new movie, “Klaus.” On a more serious note, we wanted to let you know that we’ll be at the Fry’s at 2724 S Signal Butte Rd. in Mesa on the first three Wednesdays of December (December 4, December 11, and December 18) from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. to ring bells for the Salvation Army. We’ll be donating our time to help increase the amount of money available during the holiday season. On December 4, our charity, Klaus Cares, will also be matching any amount that is donated through the kettles and on our website at klausteamcares.org if you can’t make it out in person. We’d love to see you out there while you’re getting groceries.

If you ever have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you.

Rent in Arizona is on the rise. In the last 15 years, rent prices in the Southeast Mesa area have almost doubled. Though these prices are rising on a national scale, prices in the Phoenix metro are rising even more.

Klaus Team agent Susanne Lynch reports that Las Vegas and Phoenix have been alternating as the cities with the highest increases in rent prices. Though there are multi-family properties in the works, many people are still choosing to rent. Because of this, prices are expected to continue increasing. Despite this, Freddie Mac reports that 82% of renters see renting as more affordable to homeownership.

Millennials and Gen-Xers are already facing pressure from rising childcare costs and student loan debt. These generations still have the dream of homeownership, but they’ve had to put it off. Some millennials, however, are still getting a foot in the door.

Though renting rates have doubled in our area, people who bought homes in 2004 are typically paying the same now as they were then. On top of this, a portion of their monthly payment goes directly into their equity because they’re paying down the loan. By owning a home, people are making an investment. The net worth of a homeowner is 34 times more than that of a renter, and it’s because of home equity.

“44% say the biggest reason why they don’t own a home is that they lack the money for a down payment.”

The benefits go beyond money. Research shows homeowners have better health, volunteer more, and have children with better reading and math skills. In addition, the children of homeowners are four times more likely to stay in school.

Homeowners receive tax benefits due to interest expenses, and they can also include capital gains due to home appreciation. CPA Mark Weech explains that homeowners may receive tax deductions because of interest and property tax. Renters, however, cannot receive these deductions.

Currently, 44% of Americans believe you need a 20% down payment to buy a home. In addition, 44% say the biggest reason why they don’t own a home is that they lack the money for a down payment. Steve Farrington of Loan Depot explains that the 20% down payment is a myth. Conventional programs let you put as little as 3% down, and FHA programs are at 3.5% down. The VA loan has no down payment requirement. On top of these, there are down payment assistance programs as well.

Nationwide, the average down payment is around 5.3%. Arizona’s average is higher, sitting around 15.78%. This is because our homes cost less when compared to other states. If someone pays less than 20% for a down payment, they must pay for mortgage insurance. 

Borrowers pay a PITY payment: principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. The lender will pay the taxes and insurance on the borrower’s behalf. When a person puts 20% down, they don’t have a mortgage insurance payment. This brings their monthly payment down significantly. The more someone invests into their home initially, the less they’ll pay over the life of the loan. 

People who switch from renting to owning are usually surprised by how affordable it is. For example, a person will only pay $1,600 per month if they buy a $270,000 home with $13,500 down and a 4% loan.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The trade war in China is providing some opportunities for homebuyers and homeowners in the 85212 and 85209 zip codes. Wall Street showed some anxiety this summer over trade tensions, and a slowing in growth has resulted in a drop in long-term bond yields.

Homeowners with higher interest rates than they prefer are taking advantage of these opportunities to make their current home more affordable.

Due to the steady and sustainable appreciation we’re seeing in the housing market, you have a tremendous opportunity to utilize some of your equity to do some great things for your home. You could remove costly private mortgage insurance, take some cash out to do remodeling, or consolidate some high-interest debt through a refinance.

“Lower rates mean lower payments and more purchasing power.”

While rates have dropped, the local economy is booming. Arizona has the fourth-fastest growing state economy in the U.S., and it’s in the top 10% in job growth. With an increased number of high-tech companies investing in East Mesa, local job growth is expected to continue.

The rates we’re seeing today are the lowest we’ve seen since the end of 2017 and goes against everything experts thought we were going to see. 

For homeowners, rates spell lower payments and lower cost of interest over the life of a loan. For buyers, rates can make a significant impact on affordability. A difference between a 4% and a 5% rate per month is over $160.

Lower rates also help buyers increase their purchasing power, allowing them to afford more of a home than they could have when rates were higher. The past few years have created great opportunities for homebuyers and homeowners to buy or refinance, and our friend Steve Farmington at Loan Depot would love to help you out.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>How Can Sellers Take Advantage of Our Current Market?</title>

        <description>

Today we’ll talk about the present state of our Phoenix Metro market and how you as a seller can take full advantage of it. 

For the month of July, inventory in the 85209 ZIP code was under a one-month supply. To put that into perspective, anything under three months’ worth of inventory is deemed a seller’s market. Looking at the year-over-year numbers, we had a 1.4 months’ supply this time last year and a 1.9 months’ supply in August 2017.   

The normal level of active listings in the Phoenix Metro as a whole is around 29,500, but we currently have fewer than 14,000 homes for sale. This means buyers have about half as much inventory to pick from, especially in the under-$400,000 price range. 

Despite the 14% drop-off in supply year over year, buyer activity remains high, and the 15.5% increase in homes under contract is evidence of that. As Mike Orr, director of Crawford Associates and former director of the Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, describes it, “The last two months have seen supply drop sharply from its already-low level, so we now have a wholly inadequate number of homes for sale to keep the market functioning normally.” 

“The combination of low inventory, low rates, high demand, and our fantastic location makes both 85209 and 85212 two great ZIP codes to own a home in.”

Orr also points to the fact that this past July saw the fewest listings come on our market since he started keeping records back in 2001. Interestingly enough, though, we’ve had 63% more homes on the market and the local population has grown by 50% since then. He goes on to say, “With new listings at a low ebb and closings at a high, this is the most unbalanced market we’ve seen in favor of sellers since 2005. Given the massive increase in housing stock since 2001, it’s amazing that we have fewer listings in 2019 than in 2001.” That is to say, homes are moving.  

The listing success rate, which is the percentage of listings that closed versus those that expire or have a canceled contract, is currently at 97%. By comparison, the success rate was just 88% last month and 89% at this time last year. 

And with lower interest rates and soaring rents, many predict that demand will continue to be high. With great freeway access, more and more shopping options, and all the new tech companies going up, our area of the Valley should continue to be a place for residents to call home. 

Our rental market is also hot, so there’s a shortage of homes available for rent. Given the fact that rates are so low, some forward-thinking homeowners are becoming investors by using the equity in their current home to purchase a second home they can rent out. The combination of low inventory, low rates, high demand, and our fantastic location makes both 85209 and 85212 two great zip codes to own a home in.If you have any questions or would like help buying or selling a home in our market, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the Klaus Team. We’d love to help you make the most informed decision for you and your family!

I won’t lie; this road has its challenges, but we’re here to be your guide as you step into the role of hero to your parents.

What’s the latest news from our East Valley market?

Before we get to that, I want to make sure you’re receiving our newest technology: Homebot. Basically, Homebot is a personalized home valuation tool that can also estimate your equity position and do many other things. If you haven’t been able to use Homebot yet, please let us know, because it’s a great tool that we’ve gotten tremendous feedback about. 

When it comes to our market, we’re in an interesting time. There are fewer homes available than what we usually see, which makes now a great time to sell. If you’re thinking about buying, the good news is that interest rates are still low. In fact, contrary to what was predicted at the end of last year, they’ve dropped even further. 

If you’re considering buying a second home or an investment property, now is an especially great opportunity. Rent prices are increasing, and there’s a big shortage of available rentals. 

We’re on top of all the latest developments in our market, so if you have any further questions or you need help buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

Today I want to take a break from real estate and share a special message about skin cancer awareness. 

As some of you know, I myself am undergoing skin cancer treatment. I’ve lived in Arizona most of my life, which means being exposed to the sun quite often, and I want to spread the word and make sure all my friends and clients out there are applying extra sunscreen each and every day and making regular visits to the dermatologist. If anything looks out of the ordinary, the sooner you catch it, the better. 

If you’d like to take a look at a handy guide about how to spot skin cancer, click on this link.

If you have any questions for me about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

I just wanted to give you a quick update as we head into the summer season. Those A/C units are going to start working hard again and it’s very important to have them tuned up and maintained before the weather heats up. Changing out those air filters can take a lot of stress and pressure off of your unit, too. If you need someone to help you service your A/C unit, we would be happy to connect you with a licensed professional. To learn more, watch this short video.

The first quarter of 2019 is already behind us, and you know what that means: Things are starting to heat up. With temperatures already well into the 80s, now is the perfect time to get your air conditioning unit serviced.

 If you’re ready to get yours ready for the warmer weather ahead, Polair Heating and Air Conditioning is offering $55 tune-ups. To learn more about how to take advantage, just reach out. We’d be happy to point you in the right direction. 

That aside, the weather isn’t all that’s heating up right now. Despite what certain doom-and-gloom headlines might say, our market is still quite healthy.

“Despite what certain doom-and-gloom headlines might say, our market is still quite healthy.”

At the moment, average interest rates are hovering between 4.5% and 5%, meaning it’s still a great time to buy a home. Even so, the rumors of a market slowdown aren’t without some truth. Things are beginning to shift, but not nearly as dramatically as some have predicted. All in all, conditions are simply becoming more balanced.

Another interesting development is the increasing popularity of iBuyers—companies that will buy your house outright at a supposedly competitive rate. While it’s true that these companies will buy your property, the deal they offer isn’t a good one. The goal of many iBuyers is to secure your property for cheap and then resell it on the open market. There are some reputable companies, but sellers must be cautious.

If you’re looking to sell or have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to help you make your goals a reality.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Fellow Agent—

We made it through yet another Arizona winter! In light of that, I wanted to take a moment to remind you that if you’re an agent from out of state who is in need of referrals, reach out to us. 

We understand the importance of referrals in our business, as well as the importance of clarity in communication. Our out-of-state network allows us to find agents to fulfill the needs of the clients you’re unable to given your location. 

And if you have any referrals of your own for us, send them to our new website, www.ReferArizona.com. The referral form is incredibly easy to complete, and we’ll get it back to you as soon as possible so that we can begin taking care of your clients.

We appreciate any opportunity to network with agents around the country.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kenny Klaus

        <description>

What’s the latest news from our area and our local real estate market now that April has arrived?

First, we have several new businesses opening in the area, including Pour Wine and Taproom, Dignity Health, and Mattamy Homes, which is a new home builder right along Highway 202. They’re also widening the highway in that area, which is great news for everyone! 

As for our market, we’re officially through the first quarter of 2019, and we haven’t quite experienced the shift we were expecting. So far, things are still looking very healthy, and interest rates are hovering between 4.5% and 5%, which is actually lower than it was at this time last year. 

“We’re officially through the first quarter of 2019, and we haven’t quite experienced the shift we were expecting.”

In the 85212 zip code, the number of active and pending listings have increased month to month, but sales have dipped slightly. Inventory, meanwhile, has also increased slightly.

In the 85209 zip code, active and pending listings have increased as well and sales increased too. Inventory, though, decreased to 2.5 months. 

Keep in mind that these are generalized figures, and our market varies from price range to price range, but, overall, things are very steady moving as we progress further into 2019. 

If you have any other questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

There are a lot of renovation mistakes we tend to see homeowners make in our market, so today we’d like to list some big home improvement pitfalls to avoid and give you advice on what you should be doing instead.

Here are some mistakes homeowners make:

1. Spending the money in the wrong places. You want to ensure you receive a good return on your investment, but not all improvements will put money back in your pocket.

2. Making uncommon improvements. If your improvement isn’t exactly on most homeowners’ wishlists, it won’t do anything to make your home stand out on the market.

3. Not calling us first. You don’t have to be buying or selling, but planning big renovations without the advice of a professional agent is a great way to meet bad outcomes.

“If you’re thinking of selling in a few years, why not make the improvements now and enjoy them yourself for a while?”

By speaking with experienced Realtors, such as those on our team, you can learn what improvements work the best in your market. We can give you suggestions, provide you with homeowner workshops, and help you get the most for your dollar.

If you’re thinking of selling in a few years, why not make the improvements now and enjoy them yourself for a while? You shouldn’t have to be making these renovations just so other people get to take advantage of them.

Give us a call and we can connect you with our great resources, help you find where your money is best spent, and keep you from making any home improvement mistakes. In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you soon.

I can’t believe we’re already a month and a half into 2019, but now that we are, it’s time to take a look back at what the beginning of this year has held for our market.

For one thing, the number of sales has dropped slightly from what we observed at this point last year, but activity does appear to be on its way up. Sellers shouldn’t despair, though. It’s still a great time to list. The only difference is that you will now need to be more careful in developing a competitive pricing strategy for your property.

“We’re currently experiencing a strong, well-balanced market that favors buyers and sellers alike.”

There’s good news for buyers, too. With increased inventory comes increased choice, meaning you are more likely to find your perfect home now than you would have been in the recent past. Also, as long as interest rates remain favorable, affordability will still remain comparatively high.

The bottom line is that we’re currently experiencing a strong, well-balanced market that favors buyers and sellers alike.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

I just wanted to make sure to give you a quick update on some of the great things we’ve got going on. On Saturday, January 26, we’re going to be hosting our Silver Group Workshop here at our office. Join us at 9 a.m. to learn more about the home-to-care transition from a couple of local experts.

The event is free to attend, and you’ll learn a lot. We’ll cover all of the things that happen when someone goes from owning a home to living in an assisted-living type situation. We’ll have coffee and donuts for you, too.

Then, starting in February, we’ll have our monthly homeowner workshops where we’ll go over everything you need to do in order to get your home ready for the market when the time is right for you.

The key for us when selling houses is seeing homes that have been perpetually maintained. That’s huge for buyers on the market right now.

If you have any questions for us or need us to connect you to any resources as a homeowner, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

First and foremost, I want to wish you a happy new year. Thank you all for another amazing year in 2018. We’re excited for what’s to come in 2019. Today we’re going to talk a little bit about what you can expect from the real estate market as we head into the new year.

Right now, we’re seeing a bit of a slowdown in the market. That’s normal for this time of year. We’re seeing more homes coming on the market, but buyer traffic should pick up relatively soon. With interest rates coming down a bit, there’s a bit more sense of urgency for buyers.

“The interest rate for renters is 100%.”

Here’s an interesting thought: The interest rate for renters is 100%. Keep that in mind the next time you think interest rates are too high for you to buy. If you’re interested in buying or investing in a home, there’s an extremely good opportunity out there with a strong rental market.

We anticipate 2019 to be a good, solid year without anything too crazy in the market. A nice, steady market is healthy for all of us. Of course homeowners want prices to keep going up like crazy, but a nice, steady increase is good for the long term.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, ask us about our instant offer program. We’re always here to look out for your best interests. If you have any other questions for me about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Are we in a real estate bubble? I’m here to answer this question today.

We are certainly seeing changes in the market right now and things are shifting. We saw interest rates increase several times this year, and we may see them increase three more times in 2019. However, let’s keep things in perspective. Right now, rates are right around 5% on average. From 2009 to 2011, they were over 6%.

Overall, the housing market has continued to be solid. We’re seeing a bit of a slowdown, to be sure, and a slight decrease in home appreciation. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however. There are still more people moving here than there are moving away. Things are changing, but we’re definitely not in a bubble.

“We should continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.”

We’ve been working on some programs with our lenders and sellers to offer a bit of an incentive to still get people qualified for a home affordably. We’re always at the forefront of this and looking out for the best interests of our clients.

We’re still in a very good market and hope to continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.

One thing I wanted to note is that if you’re currently moving or considering a move and you need to donate some things, the Salvation Army has a great program where they’ll come and pick up everything and donate it to a great cause.

If you have any questions about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.

To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.

“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves. So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.

And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.

“Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.”

According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”

Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.

The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.

If you’ve got moving or storage needs Justin and his team can help with, give Just-In Time Moving and Storage a call at (480) 213-0395 or visit www.jitmoving.com.

And, as always, if you have any other questions for us at the Klaus Team, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

It’s time for another market update, and we’ve seen some interesting changes since the last time we examined local real estate trends.

First, as you may already know, our overall Arizona market has been very strong in 2018 with respect to appreciation and sales. However, as predicted, rising interest rates have now caused an increase in inventory—and this has led to a slight slowdown in our market. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though.

In essence, this change simply means that sellers will need to be especially cognizant of their pricing strategies. And buyers, too, can reap certain advantages by making their move in today’s market. For instance, even though interest rates have increased, they are still historically low. This means buyers still have the opportunity to lock in a favorable rate before the Fed makes even more increases—as is expected to be the case as we head into 2019.

“Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.”

The bottom line is that our market is beginning to balance out. We’ve been in a seller’s market for some time, but conditions have started to level off.

Overall, there’s a lot happening in our Arizona right now. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you, and our team would be happy to help you with any of these goals.

Even if you aren’t ready to make a move immediately, we would still like to help you stay informed. We offer a number of great events, and we highly encourage you to come out and expand your knowledge of real estate. You can find more information about our team and the events we offer by visiting our website:www.klausteam.com.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Our recent homeowner workshops have been massively successful, and it’s been very interesting to see the responses of those who have attended.

Our tips on preparing homes for the market, in particular, have been extremely well-received. If you’re curious about buying or selling, or simply want to better understand our market, I would highly encourage you to check out our next workshop. You will learn which upgrades and repairs bring the greatest return on investment, as well as a number of other things you can do to boost your chance of success in the market.

And if you have already attended one of these events, I would still encourage you to join us again. In addition to covering some of the basic information I mentioned earlier, we will also be covering current market trends. Our goal is to keep you informed as our market develops, so that you can be successful with your own buying or selling experience.

“We want to help you stay educated and up-to-date on all things related to local real estate.”

There is a lot of conflicting information out there about our market and about real estate in general. These workshops are designed to help you separate fact from fiction. We want to help you stay educated and up-to-date on all things related to local real estate. If you’re interested in attending our next workshop, click here for more information.
