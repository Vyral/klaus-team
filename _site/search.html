On Saturday, January 26, we’re going to be hosting our Silver Group Workshop here at our office. Join us at 9 a.m. to learn more about the home-to-care transition from a couple of local experts.The event is free to attend, and you’ll learn a lot. We’ll cover all of the things that happen when someone goes from owning a home to living in an assisted-living type situation. We’ll have coffee and donuts for you, too.Then, starting in February, we’ll have our monthly homeowner workshops where we’ll go over everything you need to do in order to get your home ready for the market when the time is right for you.The key for us when selling houses is seeing homes that have been perpetually maintained. That’s huge for buyers on the market right now.If you have any questions for us or need us to connect you to any resources as a homeowner, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "First and foremost, I want to wish you a Happy New Year. Thank you all for another amazing year in 2018. We’re excited for what’s to come in 2019. Today we’re going to talk a little bit about what you can expect from the real estate market as we head into the new year.Right now, we’re seeing a bit of a slowdown in the market. That’s normal for this time of year. We’re seeing more homes coming on the market, but buyer traffic should pick up relatively soon. With interest rates coming down a bit, there’s a bit more sense of urgency for buyers.“The interest rate for renters is 100%.”Here’s an interesting thought. The interest rate for renters is 100%. Keep that in mind that next time you think interest rates are too high for you to buy. If you’re interested in buying or investing in a home, there’s an extremely good opportunity out there with a strong rental market.We anticipate 2019 to be a good, solid year without anything too crazy in the market. A nice, steady market is healthy for all of us. Of course homeowners want prices to keep going up like crazy, but a nice, steady increase is good for the long term.If you’re thinking of selling your home, ask us about our instant offer program. We’re always here to look out for your best interests. If you have any other questions for me about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

His exploratory and entrepreneurial spirit led him to Arizona in 2006, where he began his Real Estate journey by obtaining his Bachelor’s degree in Real Estate at ASU’s W.P. Carey College of Business. Upon graduating, he began working in Commercial Real Estate and Acquisitions. Over the years Matt has also been fortunate enough to explore different facets of real estate by also working with the government in Right of Way, and then moving into Residential Real Estate sales full-time. His education, his experience in various aspects of Real Estate, and his commitment to excellence in customer satisfaction allow him to easily connect with clients, understand their needs, and make the buying/selling process as easy and stress-free as possible.

        "content": "Are we in a real estate bubble? I’m here to answer this question today.We are certainly seeing changes in the market right now and things are shifting. We saw interest rates increase several times this year, and we may see them increase three more times in 2019. However, let’s keep things in perspective. Right now, rates are right around 5% on average. From 2009 to 2011, they were over 6%.Overall, the housing market has continued to be solid. We’re seeing a bit of a slowdown, to be sure, and a slight decrease in home appreciation. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however. There are still more people moving here than there are moving away. Things are changing, but we’re definitely not in a bubble.“We should continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.”We’ve been working on some programs with our lenders and sellers to offer a bit of an incentive to still get people qualified for a home affordably. We’re always at the forefront of this and looking out for the best interests of our clients.We’re still in a very good market and hope to continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.One thing I wanted to note is that if you’re currently moving or considering a move and you need to donate some things, the Salvation Army has a great program where they’ll come and pick up everything and donate it to a great cause.If you have any questions about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves. So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.“Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.”According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.If you’ve got moving or storage needs Justin and his team can help with, give Just-In Time Moving and Storage a call at (480) 213-0395 or visit www.jitmoving.com.And, as always, if you have any other questions for us at the Klaus Team, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "It’s time for another market update, and we’ve seen some interesting changes since the last time we examined local real estate trends.First, as you may already know, our overall Arizona market has been very strong in 2018 with respect to appreciation and sales. However, as predicted, rising interest rates have now caused an increase in inventory—and this has led to a slight slowdown in our market. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though.In essence, this change simply means that sellers will need to be especially cognizant of their pricing strategies. And buyers, too, can reap certain advantages by making their move in today’s market. For instance, even though interest rates have increased, they are still historically low. This means buyers still have the opportunity to lock in a favorable rate before the Fed makes even more increases—as is expected to be the case as we head into 2019.“Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.”The bottom line is that our market is beginning to balance out. We’ve been in a seller’s market for some time, but conditions have started to level off.Overall, there’s a lot happening in our Arizona right now. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you, and our team would be happy to help you with any of these goals.Even if you aren’t ready to make a move immediately, we would still like to help you stay informed. We offer a number of great events, and we highly encourage you to come out and expand your knowledge of real estate. You can find more information about our team and the events we offer by visiting our website:www.klausteam.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
