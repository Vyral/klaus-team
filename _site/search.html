        "content": "There’s plenty of noise out there about our current real estate market. So today we wanted to cut through it and share what’s truly happening in our local market.The good news is that we’re still seeing a very healthy market overall. The market continues to favor sellers, but it’s beginning to slow down somewhat. The end of March and early April was the peak of the multiple offers and bidding war chaos. That’s still happening, but not as much as it was before.Interest rates remain low, and we anticipate they’ll stay that way through this year and hopefully into the next. However, with the way the world is these days, you never know what changes may happen. The top five real estate economists have predicted that within the next five years, we should see a gradual downturn in appreciation. We predict to see somewhere in the mid-fours and upper-threes within the next five years. In my opinion, that’s great news because the housing market is stable. You should also know that mortgage payments are very affordable compared to rents in this market.Additionally, we have an array of people moving here because of the large companies coming here to the East Valley. There’s a new Facebook data center, Apple, Gateway, the Legacy sports complex, and more. They’re bringing more jobs, which brings more people. I think we’ll continue to see an excellent market in Phoenix.“We’re still seeing a very healthy market overall.”If you’ve considered buying a second property, a slew of people are sitting on quite a bit of equity today, which is money just sitting there not working for you. The investment market is very strong at the moment; we’re undersupplied on rentals.We’re here every day working hard and ensuring we’re keeping up with the latest technologies and tools to best serve you. We appreciate your continued support and referrals; they’re the lifeblood of our business.We know there’s a bunch of information and programs out there, so if you have questions about them or anything having to do with real estate, call us first. We work with those programs and can guide you through all your different options and help you decide what’s best for yourself and your family.",

We’re always here to be your trusted resource in real estate. We’re here in the trenches every day conducting business, and people are still buying and selling real estate. We have excellent strategies to help buyers get into their new homes; we win more contracts than the average real estate agent. We also have strategies to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible for our sellers. “We’re always here as your trusted source in real estate.”If you’re considering taking advantage of the current market but are worried about finding a new house because of the low inventory—you’d be surprised. Properties come up for sale all the time, but you need to be in a position to jump when the right one appears. We have a Buy First, Then Sell program where you won’t have to give up your equity; we’ll find your new home first, secure it, move in, then prepare your first house for the market. We also have a Sell and Stay program as well as Lease Purchase programs for those who are trying to get into the market but can’t quite purchase yet. Don’t ever hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email if you have questions about buying, selling, or anything else. Also, contact us if you want an update on your home’s current market value straight from us—not from some iffy online site. Additionally, we always have home service referrals for when you need something done in your house. Enjoy the Super Bowl!",

I truly wish we had some of these programs in the past to make the process of buying and selling real estate easier. We realize that not everyone fits into the same category—we have programs for those looking to buy and sell at the same time, sell and then stay in their home to release some of their equity, lease their next property so they can buy it within the next five years, etc. With interest rates as low as they are, buyer demand is high, so we’d love to have a quick conversation with you to outline your options.

Despite all the chaos going on in our world, the real estate market has remained very steady, anchored by low interest rates and low inventory. We’re grateful for this resilient market, and we’re excited to be turning our attention toward making the holidays brighter for a few families in our community. We are heading into the fifth year with our charity, Klaus Team Cares. For every person you refer and every home you buy or sell with us, we take a portion of that commission and donate it back to Klaus Team Cares, allowing us to then give back directly to local communities. This year we’re serving 24 families (84 total kids) that were brought to our attention as needing some assistance for Christmas. We commissioned a group to do all of the shopping for these families, and we held a wrapping party last Saturday. We’re ready to make this holiday season special for our neighbors who are experiencing hardship in these especially trying times. Our effort to give back is merely an outpouring of our deep appreciation; we’re so thankful for your continued support and your referrals, which allow us to do so much good here in the local community. “This year we’re serving 24 families (84 total kids) that were brought to our attention as needing some assistance for Christmas.”For those of you who receive our local newsletter, you’ll be able to read about some additional ways that you can help us support our community.

On Wednesday, December 9, the Klaus Team Cares charity will match any donation that is made to the Salvation Army. Stop by and drop your donation in one of the kettles, or donate by visiting klausteamcares.org. Again, thank you for all that you do for us here at the Klaus Team. 2020 hasn’t been an easy year for most of us, but it’s inspiring to see everyone pull together.

We at the Klaus Team are excited to introduce our Lease to Own program, a new way to rent first then buy. Here’s how it works: First, we help you qualify for the right program; we have multiple solutions with flexible income and credit requirements to accommodate your specific situation. Next, you’ll choose a new home you love that’s listed for sale (most single-family homes and townhomes qualify), and our partner will purchase the property on your behalf. Once the purchase is completed, you move in as a tenant and begin paying rent; you can lease anywhere from two to five years. In some cases, a percentage of rent goes toward your down payment. Finally, you may choose to buy the home during your lease term, or, you can simply walk away at the end of the lease.  When you choose to purchase, you begin building equity and wealth. We have more solutions than ever before to help people transition into a new living space.

This unique option has an approximate 85% success rate for clients to transition from the lease purchase to ownership; the typical industry has only seen about a 5% success rate over the years, which is far from a win-win for the potential tenant/buyer. What’s awesome about our program is that it allows you to go out and look at homes just like a homebuyer. Then our partners step in and buy the property you’ve identified at today’s rates and prices; the great news here is that they’re assumable loans, so whether it takes one, three, or five years for you to qualify for a full purchase of that property, you’ll still lock in today’s rates and assume the equity position that’s been built up. When you do take ownership, you’ll just pay 1% over that equity. “Reach out for a no-hassle consultation to see if this is a good fit for you or your loved ones.”This could be a great opportunity for someone who’s currently paying off someone else’s mortgage in the form of demoralizing rent payments. If you’re a parent who has kids who are renting at the moment, this program could be a wonderful first step for them.

We here at The Klaus Team have never left anyone homeless, and we won’t start with you. We’re excited to announce our Buy Then Sell program.

In this environment, it’s in your best interest to not occupy your property while showings occur, which means this program is ideal. Having a vacant, move-in ready home to show buyers also increases your odds of netting more money in the sale. “As your real estate professionals, we keep adapting to make sure we bring you the best tools available on the market.”We’d love to share more about this amazing program with you, so feel free to contact us for a no-hassle consultation to see if it’s a good fit.

If you’re thinking of selling, now’s a great time to capture the equity you’ve built in your home. If you’re a buyer, you may face some challenges due to said multiple-offer situations and contingency-related issues. The great news is that, though real estate has been done the same way for the last 100 years, The Klaus Team now has even more options for buyers and sellers. Not only do we have programs to help sellers get their home ready for the market, but we have some great lease-purchase programs for buyers. For example, we have a new program that allows you to shop for homes and, after you’ve found the one you want, a company will buy it for you and allow you to lease it back. “Not everyone fits into the same program, so we’d be happy to schedule you a no-hassle consultation so you understand your options.”If you need to buy and sell at the same time, we have another program we’re getting ready to release that provides you the financing to buy your next home while owning your current one. After you’ve made your purchase, we’ll get your original home ready for the market so you can get full retail price for it. Putting their home on the market without knowing whether the home they want next will be out there waiting for them is a big fear among home sellers, but this program solves that concern. The point is, we’re always adapting to the market. Not everyone fits into the same program, so we’d be happy to schedule you a no-hassle consultation so you understand your options. With the advances in technology and the amount of venture capital money out there, it’s created some unique buying and selling scenarios.

        "content": "If you’re wondering how our Arizona real estate market is doing, I have good news: After a bit of a lull, things are starting to pick up again. Despite everything that’s happened since the COVID-19 lockdown, we’ve seen an increase in activity (much of which has been driven by historically low interest rates) and continue to see home values appreciate, much of which has been driven by historically low interest rates. This situation reminds some people of the housing market crash of 2008 and 2009, but there are a few key statistics that illustrate the difference between now and then. First of all, 58.7% of all homes in America have at least 60% equity—the growth of home prices nationwide has helped the market stay stable. Secondly, 42% of all homes are owned free and clear, which means those homeowners don’t have to sell no matter what happens to the market. “We’ve seen an increase in activity and continue to see home values appreciate.”Also, the average equity in mortgaged homes is $177,000. Back in 2008, homeowners could take out almost 100% of their equity, which means if there was even the slightest market shift, they’d end up in the negative. Currently, we’re seeing people sitting on almost $200,000 worth of equity. Basically, tighter lending guidelines have helped homeowners because they can’t take out as much equity. That being said, sitting on that kind of equity means that money’s not working for you. If you’re curious about unleashing some of your equity and using it to buy a second home, I can tell you that many people build wealth through real estate. It almost sounds illegal—you can get a loan in the neighborhood of 20% down to pay off your mortgage—but it’s real, and many investors do it. Knowledge is power, and the opportunity to understand your investment options is critical in building long-term wealth and earning financial freedom and stability. If you’d like to learn more about investing in real estate or have any questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Rent in Arizona is on the rise. In the last 15 years, rent prices in the Southeast Mesa area have almost doubled. Though these prices are rising on a national scale, prices in the Phoenix metro are rising even more.Klaus Team agent Susanne Lynch reports that Las Vegas and Phoenix have been alternating as the cities with the highest increases in rent prices. Though there are multi-family properties in the works, many people are still choosing to rent. Because of this, prices are expected to continue increasing. Despite this, Freddie Mac reports that 82% of renters see renting as more affordable to homeownership.Millennials and Gen-Xers are already facing pressure from rising childcare costs and student loan debt. These generations still have the dream of homeownership, but they’ve had to put it off. Some millennials, however, are still getting a foot in the door.Though renting rates have doubled in our area, people who bought homes in 2004 are typically paying the same now as they were then. On top of this, a portion of their monthly payment goes directly into their equity because they’re paying down the loan. By owning a home, people are making an investment. The net worth of a homeowner is 34 times more than that of a renter, and it’s because of home equity.“44% say the biggest reason why they don’t own a home is that they lack the money for a down payment.”The benefits go beyond money. Research shows homeowners have better health, volunteer more, and have children with better reading and math skills. In addition, the children of homeowners are four times more likely to stay in school.Homeowners receive tax benefits due to interest expenses, and they can also include capital gains due to home appreciation. CPA Mark Weech explains that homeowners may receive tax deductions because of interest and property tax. Renters, however, cannot receive these deductions.Currently, 44% of Americans believe you need a 20% down payment to buy a home. In addition, 44% say the biggest reason why they don’t own a home is that they lack the money for a down payment. Steve Farrington of Loan Depot explains that the 20% down payment is a myth. Conventional programs let you put as little as 3% down, and FHA programs are at 3.5% down. The VA loan has no down payment requirement. On top of these, there are down payment assistance programs as well.Nationwide, the average down payment is around 5.3%. Arizona’s average is higher, sitting around 15.78%. This is because our homes cost less when compared to other states. If someone pays less than 20% for a down payment, they must pay for mortgage insurance. Borrowers pay a PITY payment: principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. The lender will pay the taxes and insurance on the borrower’s behalf. When a person puts 20% down, they don’t have a mortgage insurance payment. This brings their monthly payment down significantly. The more someone invests into their home initially, the less they’ll pay over the life of the loan. People who switch from renting to owning are usually surprised by how affordable it is. For example, a person will only pay $1,600 per month if they buy a $270,000 home with $13,500 down and a 4% loan.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "The trade war in China is providing some opportunities for homebuyers and homeowners in the 85212 and 85209 zip codes. Wall Street showed some anxiety this summer over trade tensions, and a slowing in growth has resulted in a drop in long-term bond yields.Homeowners with higher interest rates than they prefer are taking advantage of these opportunities to make their current home more affordable.Due to the steady and sustainable appreciation we’re seeing in the housing market, you have a tremendous opportunity to utilize some of your equity to do some great things for your home. You could remove costly private mortgage insurance, take some cash out to do remodeling, or consolidate some high-interest debt through a refinance.“Lower rates mean lower payments and more purchasing power.”While rates have dropped, the local economy is booming. Arizona has the fourth-fastest growing state economy in the U.S., and it’s in the top 10% in job growth. With an increased number of high-tech companies investing in East Mesa, local job growth is expected to continue.The rates we’re seeing today are the lowest we’ve seen since the end of 2017 and goes against everything experts thought we were going to see. For homeowners, rates spell lower payments and lower cost of interest over the life of a loan. For buyers, rates can make a significant impact on affordability. A difference between a 4% and a 5% rate per month is over $160.Lower rates also help buyers increase their purchasing power, allowing them to afford more of a home than they could have when rates were higher. The past few years have created great opportunities for homebuyers and homeowners to buy or refinance, and our friend Steve Farmington at Loan Depot would love to help you out.If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "How Can Sellers Take Advantage of Our Current Market?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we’ll talk about the present state of our Phoenix Metro market and how you as a seller can take full advantage of it. For the month of July, inventory in the 85209 ZIP code was under a one-month supply. To put that into perspective, anything under three months’ worth of inventory is deemed a seller’s market. Looking at the year-over-year numbers, we had a 1.4 months’ supply this time last year and a 1.9 months’ supply in August 2017.   The normal level of active listings in the Phoenix Metro as a whole is around 29,500, but we currently have fewer than 14,000 homes for sale. This means buyers have about half as much inventory to pick from, especially in the under-$400,000 price range. Despite the 14% drop-off in supply year over year, buyer activity remains high, and the 15.5% increase in homes under contract is evidence of that. As Mike Orr, director of Crawford Associates and former director of the Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, describes it, “The last two months have seen supply drop sharply from its already-low level, so we now have a wholly inadequate number of homes for sale to keep the market functioning normally.” “The combination of low inventory, low rates, high demand, and our fantastic location makes both 85209 and 85212 two great ZIP codes to own a home in.”Orr also points to the fact that this past July saw the fewest listings come on our market since he started keeping records back in 2001. Interestingly enough, though, we’ve had 63% more homes on the market and the local population has grown by 50% since then. He goes on to say, “With new listings at a low ebb and closings at a high, this is the most unbalanced market we’ve seen in favor of sellers since 2005. Given the massive increase in housing stock since 2001, it’s amazing that we have fewer listings in 2019 than in 2001.” That is to say, homes are moving.  The listing success rate, which is the percentage of listings that closed versus those that expire or have a canceled contract, is currently at 97%. By comparison, the success rate was just 88% last month and 89% at this time last year. And with lower interest rates and soaring rents, many predict that demand will continue to be high. With great freeway access, more and more shopping options, and all the new tech companies going up, our area of the Valley should continue to be a place for residents to call home. Our rental market is also hot, so there’s a shortage of homes available for rent. Given the fact that rates are so low, some forward-thinking homeowners are becoming investors by using the equity in their current home to purchase a second home they can rent out. The combination of low inventory, low rates, high demand, and our fantastic location makes both 85209 and 85212 two great zip codes to own a home in.If you have any questions or would like help buying or selling a home in our market, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the Klaus Team.

        "content": "First and foremost, I want to wish you a happy new year. Thank you all for another amazing year in 2018. We’re excited for what’s to come in 2019. Today we’re going to talk a little bit about what you can expect from the real estate market as we head into the new year.Right now, we’re seeing a bit of a slowdown in the market. That’s normal for this time of year. We’re seeing more homes coming on the market, but buyer traffic should pick up relatively soon. With interest rates coming down a bit, there’s a bit more sense of urgency for buyers.“The interest rate for renters is 100%.”Here’s an interesting thought: The interest rate for renters is 100%. Keep that in mind the next time you think interest rates are too high for you to buy. If you’re interested in buying or investing in a home, there’s an extremely good opportunity out there with a strong rental market.We anticipate 2019 to be a good, solid year without anything too crazy in the market. A nice, steady market is healthy for all of us. Of course homeowners want prices to keep going up like crazy, but a nice, steady increase is good for the long term.If you’re thinking of selling your home, ask us about our instant offer program. We’re always here to look out for your best interests. If you have any other questions for me about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Are we in a real estate bubble? I’m here to answer this question today.We are certainly seeing changes in the market right now and things are shifting. We saw interest rates increase several times this year, and we may see them increase three more times in 2019. However, let’s keep things in perspective. Right now, rates are right around 5% on average. From 2009 to 2011, they were over 6%.Overall, the housing market has continued to be solid. We’re seeing a bit of a slowdown, to be sure, and a slight decrease in home appreciation. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however. There are still more people moving here than there are moving away. Things are changing, but we’re definitely not in a bubble.“We should continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.”We’ve been working on some programs with our lenders and sellers to offer a bit of an incentive to still get people qualified for a home affordably. We’re always at the forefront of this and looking out for the best interests of our clients.We’re still in a very good market and hope to continue to see a solid, stable market for the next few years.One thing I wanted to note is that if you’re currently moving or considering a move and you need to donate some things, the Salvation Army has a great program where they’ll come and pick up everything and donate it to a great cause.If you have any questions about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves. So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.“Whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move.”According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.If you’ve got moving or storage needs Justin and his team can help with, give Just-In Time Moving and Storage a call at (480) 213-0395 or visit www.jitmoving.com.And, as always, if you have any other questions for us at the Klaus Team, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "It’s time for another market update, and we’ve seen some interesting changes since the last time we examined local real estate trends.First, as you may already know, our overall Arizona market has been very strong in 2018 with respect to appreciation and sales. However, as predicted, rising interest rates have now caused an increase in inventory—and this has led to a slight slowdown in our market. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though.In essence, this change simply means that sellers will need to be especially cognizant of their pricing strategies. And buyers, too, can reap certain advantages by making their move in today’s market. For instance, even though interest rates have increased, they are still historically low. This means buyers still have the opportunity to lock in a favorable rate before the Fed makes even more increases—as is expected to be the case as we head into 2019.“Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you.”The bottom line is that our market is beginning to balance out. We’ve been in a seller’s market for some time, but conditions have started to level off.Overall, there’s a lot happening in our Arizona right now. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest, there are opportunities available right now for you, and our team would be happy to help you with any of these goals.Even if you aren’t ready to make a move immediately, we would still like to help you stay informed. We offer a number of great events, and we highly encourage you to come out and expand your knowledge of real estate.
