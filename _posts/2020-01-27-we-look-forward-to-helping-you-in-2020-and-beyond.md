2019 was an amazing year for the real estate market, and 2020 is primed to outpace it. Demand is high, supply is low (as are interest rates), and it’s an election year. Statistics show that roughly 681,000 people moved out of California last year, and many of them ended up here in Arizona.

**Whether you’re thinking of buying or selling, we’d love it if you gave us a call.** If you’re thinking of purchasing an investment property, feel free to schedule a no-obligation consultation with us as well, because that market is even busier than the regular market.&nbsp;

There is a lot of marketing happening out there with iBuyers like Zillow, Offerpad, and OpenDoor, but if you decide to sell to one of these companies, let us help you do so; we can walk you through all of your options so that your identity is protected. We’ll represent you throughout the entire process, and it won’t cost you a thing. More importantly, we’ll provide you with a go-to-market value for your home and offer refinancing programs if you’re looking to unlock some equity.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, we have every service you need under one roof. We look forward to helping you in 2020 and beyond.
