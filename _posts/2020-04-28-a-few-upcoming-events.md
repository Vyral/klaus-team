I hope you’re all staying safe as we get through this historic time. I have a few upcoming events to share. First, we’re holding a town hall Zoom meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Our town councilman Kevin Thompson will be there, and we’ll be discussing what’s happening economically in the Southeast Valley: what’s new, changing, and coming. We’ll also be talking about the real estate market. To learn about our other upcoming events, watch the short video above.
