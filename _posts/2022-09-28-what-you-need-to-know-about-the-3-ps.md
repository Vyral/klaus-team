Looking to sell your home in this shifting housing market? If so, you need to understand the three Ps of real estate. Here are three factors you need to nail to sell for top dollar:

**1\. Price.** Unfortunately, you can’t just list your home at what price you’d like a buyer to pay for it. Instead, look at the data and price according to your area and similar properties. Buyers won’t look at your home if they think it’s a bad deal.

**2\. Presentation.** This factor is all about how buyers perceive your property. To buff up your presentation, you could do something as simple as cleaning your windows or something as involved as a minor kitchen renovation. Either way, your agent should guide you on what changes you need to make to sell for top dollar.&nbsp;

**3\. Performance.** You can’t just throw a for-sale sign in your yard and receive 20 offers in this market. To succeed, you’ll need to work with a real estate expert who has worked in a challenging market before. The best agent will go above and beyond to do the little things and get you the best results possible.&nbsp;
