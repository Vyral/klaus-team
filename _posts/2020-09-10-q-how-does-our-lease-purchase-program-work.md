We’re excited to announce our new lease purchase program available now. **This unique option has an approximate 85% success rate** for clients to transition from the lease purchase to ownership; the typical industry has only seen about a 5% success rate over the years, which is far from a win-win for the potential tenant/buyer.&nbsp;

What’s awesome about our program is that it allows you to go out and look at homes just like a homebuyer. Then our partners step in and buy the property you’ve identified at today’s rates and prices; the great news here is that they’re assumable loans, so whether it takes one, three, or five years for you to qualify for a full purchase of that property, you’ll still lock in today’s rates and assume the equity position that’s been built up. When you do take ownership, you’ll just pay 1% over that equity.&nbsp;

**This could be a great opportunity for someone who's currently paying off*****someone else’s *****mortgage in the form of demoralizing rent payments.** If you’re a parent who has kids who are renting at the moment, this program could be a wonderful first step for them. We'd be more than happy to set up a consultation and explain how their living expenses can start working for them. Follow the links on this blog and contact us right away for more information.&nbsp;

Why not reach out for a no-hassle consultation to see if this is a good fit for you or your loved ones? Being a homeowner is a great feeling, and that’s why we want to leverage all of our tools and expertise to provide folks with a path toward homeownership.&nbsp;
