The Klaus Teamâ€™s Shane Goff and Kenny Klaus share their personal stories of overcoming devastating fires and rebuilding their lives. Shane shares his journey of rebuilding his home, which was completely destroyed by a fire originating from his neighbor's property. Kenny recounts the experience of the destructive fire that consumed the original Hub Grill and Bar on New Year's Eve 2020, and the long process of rebuilding and reopening the beloved restaurant, spanning two and a half years. Together, they discuss the initial steps after the fires, navigating insurance claims, coping with the loss of cherished memories, invaluable lessons learned, and the profound emotional impact of fire and recovery.
