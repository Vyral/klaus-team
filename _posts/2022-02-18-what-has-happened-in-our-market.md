A lot is going on in the real estate market right now, so we wanted to bring you a quick update. Home values have continued to rise, but the big news is the interest rates. **We weren’t expecting rates to move until summer, but they have already climbed in January.** They broke 4% recently for the first time in a while.

However, the rates are still great, and the market is staying steady. It is very competitive for buyers right now, but **we have some great new programs that can help you buy.** If you want to move but don’t know where you would go, our buy-first-then-sell program can help you with that.&nbsp;

Also, check out our podcast, State 48 Homeowner. On it, we interview trusted vendors, share some tips and tricks, talk about the market, and more. You can find us wherever you get your podcasts. Our last episode goes over 72 Sold and what exactly it is.&nbsp;

As always, we appreciate your support, your referrals, and your loyalty. If you have any questions, feel free to call us. We want to be your real estate resource.
