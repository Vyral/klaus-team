First and foremost, I want to wish you a happy new year. Thank you all for another amazing year in 2018. We’re excited for what’s to come in 2019. **Today we’re going to talk a little bit about what you can expect from the real estate market as we head into the new year.**

Right now, we’re seeing a bit of a slowdown in the market. That's normal for this time of year. We’re seeing more homes coming on the market, but buyer traffic should pick up relatively soon. **With interest rates coming down a bit, there’s a bit more sense of urgency for buyers.**

Here’s an interesting thought: The interest rate for renters is 100%. Keep that in mind that next time you think interest rates are too high for you to buy. If you’re interested in buying or investing in a home, there’s an extremely good opportunity out there with a strong rental market.

**We anticipate 2019 to be a good, solid year without anything too crazy in the market.** A nice, steady market is healthy for all of us. Of course homeowners want prices to keep going up like crazy, but a nice, steady increase is good for the long term.
