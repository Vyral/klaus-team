Trends in our market have been favorable overall in 2019, and we expect that to continue throughout 2020 and beyond for multiple reasons:

* Inventory is still low, so sellers are finding some great opportunities and a nice appreciation rate.
* There are still properties out there for buyers.
* Interest rates are very low, meaning home affordability is up.
* Due to rising rents, the market is stable. People won’t soon walk away from their properties like they did back in 2008.

**These are all great signals for the real estate market to come.** If you are currently renting, you might be able to get a home for less per month than you’re paying for rent. On the flip side, if you have some equity in your current home and are thinking about remodeling or refinancing, give us a call. We’ll help guide you through all your wealth-building options.
