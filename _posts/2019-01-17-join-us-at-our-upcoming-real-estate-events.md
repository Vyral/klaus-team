I just wanted to make sure to give you a quick update on some of the great things we’ve got going on. **On Saturday, January 26, we’re going to be hosting our Silver Group Workshop here at our office.** Join us at 9 a.m. to learn more about the home-to-care transition from a couple of local experts.

The event is free to attend, and you’ll learn a lot. We’ll cover all of the things that happen when someone goes from owning a home to living in an assisted-living type situation. We’ll have coffee and donuts for you, too.

**Then, starting in February, we’ll have our monthly homeowner workshops** where we’ll go over everything you need to do in order to get your home ready for the market when the time is right for you.

The key for us when selling houses is seeing homes that have been perpetually maintained. That’s huge for buyers on the market right now.

If you have any questions for us or need us to connect you to any resources as a homeowner, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
