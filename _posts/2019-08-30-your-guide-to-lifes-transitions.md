When you were young, one of the first lessons you learned was that not all heroes wear capes. As you got older and wiser, you realized that it was never as easy as your parents made it look to be the heroes they were. But now, times have changed. We’re all a little older, life is doing what life does, and your hero needs a hero—they need you. I won’t lie; this road has its challenges, but we’re here to be your guide as you step into the role of hero to your parents. Join us at our office in Mesa on Thursday, September 26, for our Senior Life Transition seminar, where we’ll answer your questions and provide solutions for senior life transition. We’re the East Valley’s leading real estate team, and we’ve teamed up with experts in senior living, transitional care, skilled care, legal and financial advice, and more to make our silver workshop a one-stop shop for all the information you need to be the hero you are.&nbsp;
