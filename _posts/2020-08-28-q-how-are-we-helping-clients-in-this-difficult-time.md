Are you thinking about making a move, but overwhelmed because your current home has recently become a classroom, gym, *and* office space? We understand the struggles of trying to find the right home while you worry about selling your current one in these unusual times. Many folks trust that selling their home will be easy but fear what may happen if they can’t find their next home. We here at The Klaus Team have never left anyone homeless, and we won’t strat with you.&nbsp;

**We’re excited to announce our Buy Then Sell program.** This limited-time, exclusive opportunity allows you to buy your new home first, move into it, and then get your old home ready to go on the market—all while avoiding double payments. In this environment, it’s in your best interest to not occupy your property while showings occur, which means this program is ideal. Having a vacant, move-in ready home to show buyers also increases your odds of netting more money in the sale.&nbsp;

We’d love to share more about his amazing program with you, so feel free to contact us for a no-hassle consultation to see if it’s a good fit. Several of our clients and their friends have already taken advantage of this. With today’s crazy low interest rates, it’s a great time to upgrade into a more accommodating property; perhaps it’s time to find a home with a space that can be your dedicated ‘Zoom room,’ or one with a larger backyard or in-ground pool.&nbsp;
