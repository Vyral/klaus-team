It’s hot out there, and I’m not just talking about the weather.&nbsp;

We’ve had an interesting past few months, to say the least, but the real estate market has stayed consistent and we’re seeing a lot of multiple-offer situations arise from the homes we’re listing lately. If you’re thinking of selling, now’s a great time to capture the equity you’ve built in your home. If you’re a buyer, you may face some challenges due to said multiple-offer situations and contingency-related issues.&nbsp;

The great news is that, though real estate has been done the same way for the last 100 years, **The Klaus Team now has even more options for buyers and sellers.** Not only do we have programs to help sellers get their home ready for the market, but we have some great lease-purchase programs for buyers. For example, we have a new program that allows you to shop for homes and, after you’ve found the one you want, a company will buy it for you and allow you to lease it back.&nbsp;

If you need to buy and sell at the same time, we have another program we’re getting ready to release that provides you the financing to buy your next home while owning your current one. After you’ve made your purchase, we’ll get your original home ready for the market so you can get full retail price for it. Putting their home on the market without knowing whether the home they want next will be out there waiting for them is a big fear among home sellers, but this program solves that concern.&nbsp;

The point is, **we’re always adapting to the market.** Not everyone fits into the same program, so we’d be happy to schedule you a no-hassle consultation so you understand your options. With the advances in technology and the amount of venture capital money out there, it’s created some unique buying and selling scenarios. If you’re thinking of investing, there’s a real shortage of rental properties out there.&nbsp;

For many people, it’s all a matter of taking a few minutes out of their day and educating themselves. You might be surprised at what’s actually available. Similarly, the referrals you and many others send us allow us to focus on getting better educated as professionals instead of chasing internet leads.&nbsp;

**We look forward to the opportunity to help you learn all the different ways to buy and sell real estate in today’s market.** We’re very competitive as a team, and it’s always our top priority to help our clients win.&nbsp;

If you’d like to start your home buying or selling journey or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
