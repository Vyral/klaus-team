Today, we have an exciting announcement that can protect you from deed fraud absolutely free. The Maricopa County Recording Office has launched a free new tool to combat the increasingly common issue of deed fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In case you don’t know, **deed fraud (also known as title fraud) is a type of real estate fraud that can have a devastating impact on homeowners and their families.** It occurs when someone fraudulently takes ownership of your property by manipulating title documents. These documents are what give you ownership rights to your property, so if you lose ownership of these, you lose ownership of your home.

**So how do criminals get away with title fraud?** One method is to forge authentic-looking title documents. Another tactic is using identity theft to execute fraudulent transfers. These criminals often target absentee owners and other vulnerable parties, so be on the lookout if you’re in this position.&nbsp;

The consequences of title fraud can be devastating, but don’t worry. The new tool from Maricopa County can protect you from this type of crime for free.&nbsp;

**[Sign up for the fraud alert system here](https://recorder.maricopa.gov/MaricopaTitleAlert/Default).**

Once you sign up, you’ll receive email alerts at the end of each day. If any title transaction has been recorded under your name, it will be marked in the email, so **you’ll be able to get on top of fraudulent transactions before they become a major issue.&nbsp;**
