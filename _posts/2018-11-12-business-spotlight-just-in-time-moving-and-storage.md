On today’s “Business Spotlight,” we’re featuring Just-In Time Moving and Storage—a great local resource for anyone planning a move.

To give you all a better idea of how Just-In Time Moving and Storage can serve your needs, we met with owner Justin Hart for a discussion about his business.

**“We’ve worked very hard over the last 13 years to make sure we provide solutions for all different types of moves.** So whether you’re moving locally, across town, across the street, or across the nation, Just-In Time Moving and Storage is fully capable of helping you with your move,” said Justin when asked about his business’ services.

And beyond helping with your move itself, Just-In Time Moving and Storage also offers short- and long-term storage in their climate-controlled warehouse. Their ultimate goal is to make your move easier, whether that means moving just a few items or transferring everything you own.

According to Justin, the difference between his and other similar businesses is that **Just-In Time Moving and Storage offers “quality men, quality trucks, and quality equipment.”**

Any move with Just-In Time will be smooth, but Justin also advises that those planning a move follow a couple key steps ahead of time to make your transition even easier. The first thing Justin recommends is to stay organized and get rid of any belongings you no longer want. This way, you aren’t paying to move items you don’t want or need.

The second piece of advice Justin shared is to plan ahead. His company books up very quickly. So if you’re looking to hire them, make sure to reach out well in advance.
