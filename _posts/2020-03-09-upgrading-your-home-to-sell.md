Considering selling your home this year? **The market will be extremely busy because interest rates are staying low.** We would like you to call us before making any upgrades or repairs to your house, as we’ve seen plenty of properties and can help you make the best decision about where to spend the money to get the best return for your investment.&nbsp;

We want you to get as much as you possibly can out of your home. For most of us, it’s our biggest investment. We can help guide you whether it’s with flooring, countertops, hardware, fixtures, and so on. It’s not always as bad as you think.&nbsp;

**If you need help unlocking some of the equity in your home to do any repairs, we have options for you.** Most of you have likely heard about the instant offer programs out there, but when you work with us, we’re on your team; we guide you through the entire process. If you’re considering selling in 2020, contact us. There’s no obligation, we’ll simply guide you through all of your options.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of selling, but not this year, it’s never too early to call or email us so we can discuss how you can begin preparing. If you have further questions, reach out to us. We look forward to serving you in 2020 and beyond.
