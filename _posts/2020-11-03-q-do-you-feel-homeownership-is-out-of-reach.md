Do you want to create long-term memories in a home, but aren’t ready to purchase yet? **We at the Klaus Team are excited to introduce our Lease to Own program, a new way to rent first then buy.** Here’s how it works: First, we help you qualify for the right program; we have multiple solutions with flexible income and credit requirements to accommodate your specific situation. Next, you’ll choose a new home you love that’s listed for sale (most single-family homes and townhomes qualify), and our partner will purchase the property on your behalf.&nbsp;

Once the purchase is completed, you move in as a tenant and begin paying rent; you can lease anywhere from two to five years. In some cases, a percentage of rent goes toward your down payment. Finally, **you may choose to buy the home during your lease term, or, you can simply walk away at the end of the lease.** &nbsp;When you choose to purchase, you begin building equity and wealth. We have more solutions than ever before to help people transition into a new living space. Reach out to us today by phone or email and we’ll get you started on the path that’s best for you\!
