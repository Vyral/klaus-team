Our current real estate market is unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my 21 years in the business. Inventory is at an all-time low, so if you’re thinking of selling or would like to know what your home is worth, you’d be surprised at what price you can fetch. Get in touch with us and **we’d be happy to give you a true home valuation.**&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of selling and buying but are afraid to do so because inventory is so low, I have great news: Now that we’re into 2021, we have more programs than we’ve ever had that allow you to pull off these simultaneous transactions. I truly wish we had some of these programs in the past to make the process of buying and selling real estate easier. We realize that not everyone fits into the same category—we have programs for those looking to buy and sell at the same time, sell and then stay in their home to release some of their equity, lease their next property so they can buy it within the next five years, etc.&nbsp;

**With interest rates as low as they are, buyer demand is high**, so we’d love to have a quick conversation with you to outline your options. As always, you’re under no obligation; we’re here to serve you. We look forward to hearing from you\!
