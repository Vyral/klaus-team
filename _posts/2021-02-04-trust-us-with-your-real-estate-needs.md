It’s Super Bowl week\! However, there’s a more important game going on out there—the real estate game. **We want to make sure you’re receiving your real estate information from a good, reliable source.** There’s so much going on in the market: low inventory, low interest rates, and tons of talk and noise. We’re always here to be your trusted resource in real estate.&nbsp;

We’re here in the trenches every day conducting business, and people are still buying and selling real estate. We have excellent strategies to help buyers get into their new homes; we win more contracts than the average real estate agent. We also have strategies to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible for our sellers.&nbsp;

If you’re considering taking advantage of the current market but are worried about finding a new house because of the low inventory—you’d be surprised. **Properties come up for sale all the time, but you need to be in a position to jump** when the right one appears. We have a Buy First, Then Sell program where you won’t have to give up your equity; we’ll find your new home first, secure it, move in, then prepare your first house for the market. We also have a Sell and Stay program as well as Lease Purchase programs for those who are trying to get into the market but can’t quite purchase yet.&nbsp;

Don’t ever hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email if you have questions about buying, selling, or anything else. Also, **contact us if you want an update on your home’s current market value straight from us**—not from some iffy online site. Additionally, we always have home service referrals for when you need something done in your house. Enjoy the Super Bowl\!
