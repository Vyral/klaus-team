I am originally from Queens, NY and have lived in Arizona since I was 5 years old. &nbsp;I have 2 sons that are 31 and 17. &nbsp;I was in banking for almost 19 years including Chase Bank for 15.5 years. &nbsp;I worked in trust department, consumer lending, home equity lending and business lending where I was a loan officer, underwriter and SBA underwriter. &nbsp;I’ve been a Realtor for 14 years, all with Keller Williams Integrity First, and with The Klaus Team for 8 years as a transaction manager, working with buyer, sellers, and short sale and HUD transactions.&nbsp;
