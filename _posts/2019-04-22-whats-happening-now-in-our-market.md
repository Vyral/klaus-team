The first quarter of 2019 is already behind us, and you know what that means: Things are starting to heat up. With temperatures already well into the 80s, now is the perfect time to get your air conditioning unit serviced.

&nbsp;If you’re ready to get yours ready for the warmer weather ahead, **Polair Heating and Air Conditioning is offering $55 tune-ups.** To learn more about how to take advantage, just reach out. We’d be happy to point you in the right direction.&nbsp;

That aside, the weather isn’t all that’s heating up right now. Despite what certain doom-and-gloom headlines might say, our market is still quite healthy.

At the moment, average interest rates are hovering between 4.5% and 5%, meaning it’s still a great time to buy a home. Even so, the rumors of a market slowdown aren’t without some truth. Things are beginning to shift, but not nearly as dramatically as some have predicted. **All in all, conditions are simply becoming more balanced.**

Another interesting development is the increasing popularity of iBuyers—companies that will buy your house outright at a supposedly competitive rate. While it’s true that these companies will buy your property, the deal they offer isn’t a good one. The goal of many iBuyers is to secure your property for cheap and then resell it on the open market. **There are some reputable companies, but sellers must be cautious.**

If you’re looking to sell or have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to help you make your goals a reality.
