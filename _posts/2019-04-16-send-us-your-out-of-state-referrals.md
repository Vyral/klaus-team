Fellow Agent—

We made it through yet another Arizona winter\! In light of that, I wanted to take a moment to remind you that if you’re an agent from out of state who is in need of referrals, reach out to us.&nbsp;

We understand the importance of referrals in our business, as well as the importance of clarity in communication. Our out-of-state network allows us to find agents to fulfill the needs of the clients you’re unable to given your location.&nbsp;

And if you have any referrals of your own for us, send them to our new website,&nbsp;[www.ReferArizona.com](http://www.referarizona.com/). The auto-populating form is easy to fill out, and we’ll get it back to you as soon as possible so that we can begin taking care of your clients.

We appreciate any opportunity to network with agents around the country.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
