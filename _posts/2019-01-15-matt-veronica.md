Matt is a dedicated, hard-working, neighborly, and family-oriented Ohio native, whose passion for the OSU Buckeyes is close to parallel to his passion for Real Estate and his desire to help people reach their goals of owning their dream homes. His exploratory and entrepreneurial spirit led him to Arizona in 2006, where he began his Real Estate journey by obtaining his Bachelor’s degree in Real Estate at ASU’s W.P. Carey College of Business. Upon graduating, he began working in Commercial Real Estate and Acquisitions. Over the years Matt has also been fortunate enough to explore different facets of real estate by also working with the government in Right of Way, and then moving into Residential Real Estate sales full-time. His education, his experience in various aspects of Real Estate, and his commitment to excellence in customer satisfaction allow him to easily connect with clients, understand their needs, and make the buying/selling process as easy and stress-free as possible. Whether you are a first-time home buyer, a seasoned investor, or simply looking to buy and sell in order to up/downsize, Matt has all of the required resources, knowledge, and experience to assist you with all of your real estate needs.
