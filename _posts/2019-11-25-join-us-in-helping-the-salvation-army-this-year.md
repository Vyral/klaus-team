I’m so excited that Netflix finally got the spelling and pronunciation right in my name for their new movie, “Klaus.” On a more serious note, we wanted to let you know that we’ll be at the Fry’s at 2724 S Signal Butte Rd. in Mesa on the first three Wednesdays of December (December 4, December 11, and December 18) from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. to ring bells for the Salvation Army. We’ll be donating our time to help increase the amount of money available during the holiday season. On December 4, our charity, Klaus Cares, will also be matching any amount that is donated through the kettles and on our website at klausteamcares.org if you can’t make it out in person. We’d love to see you out there while you're getting groceries.
