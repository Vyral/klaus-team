Today I want to take a break from real estate and share a special message about skin cancer awareness.&nbsp;

As some of you know, I myself am undergoing skin cancer treatment. I’ve lived in Arizona most of my life, which means being exposed to the sun quite often, and I want to spread the word and make sure all my friends and clients out there are applying extra sunscreen each and every day and making regular visits to the dermatologist. If anything looks out of the ordinary, the sooner you catch it, the better.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to take a look at a handy guide about how to spot skin cancer,** **[click on this link.](https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/articles/2018/july/how-to-spot-skin-cancer?j=1613748&amp;e=kenny@thekennyklausteam.com&amp;l=331_HTML&amp;u=54332360&amp;mid=7240369&amp;jb=167){: target="_blank"}**
