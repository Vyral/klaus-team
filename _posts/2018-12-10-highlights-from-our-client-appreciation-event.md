Every year, the Klaus Team celebrates our clients and their families by renting out a theatre at the Harkins Superstition 25 movie theatre. The movie shown this year was “Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet”, it’s no surprise why the movie is #1 in the box office! The room was filled with laughter.

Santa stopped by to visit with the children and take family photos, which was a bit hit!

With some help from our vendors and business partners, the Klaus Team awarded our clients with gift cards, gift baskets and other prizes through a raffle!

Attached are some photos from the event.
