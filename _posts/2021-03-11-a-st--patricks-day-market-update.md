Happy St. Patrick’s Day\! Today I’m just sharing some quick information.&nbsp;

You may have heard how crazy our market currently is due to low inventory. Buyers are having a difficult time finding new homes because there are multiple offers on most properties. Our team has helped over 40 buyers get under contract already this year. **There’s no luck involved—it’s pure skill.** We’ve been doing this for over 20 years; we have strategies and tools that help our client’s offers stand out from the rest and help them win.

If you have a house to sell and you’re concerned that you won’t find one to buy, our Buy First and Sell program is the right tool for you. We’ve had dozens of clients take advantage of this program; **you don’t sacrifice your equity.** You move into your new property first, prepare your other home for sale, list it, and then get top dollar.&nbsp;

Give us a call or send an email for more details about how we can help you buy or sell or if you have any questions. We’d love to provide a free consultation with no hassle or obligation. Enjoy St. Patrick’s Day\!
