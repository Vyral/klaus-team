What’s the latest news from our area and our local real estate market now that April has arrived?

First, we have several new businesses opening in the area, including Pour Wine and Taproom, Dignity Health, and Mattamy Homes, which is a new home builder right along Highway 202. They’re also widening the highway in that area, which is great news for everyone!&nbsp;

As for our market, we’re officially through the first quarter of 2019, and **we haven’t quite experienced the shift we were expecting.** So far, things are still looking very healthy, and interest rates are hovering between 4.5% and 5%, which is actually lower than it was at this time last year.&nbsp;

In the 85212 zip code, the number of active and pending listings have increased month to month, but sales have dipped slightly. Inventory, meanwhile, has also increased slightly.

In the 85209 zip code, active and pending listings have increased as well and sales increased too. Inventory, though, decreased to 2.5 months.&nbsp;

Keep in mind that these are generalized figures, and our market varies from price range to price range, but, **overall, things are very steady moving as we progress further into 2019.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
