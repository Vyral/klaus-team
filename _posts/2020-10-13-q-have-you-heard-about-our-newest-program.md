Here at the Klaus Team, we’re proud to introduce our **[Buy Then Sell](https://www.klausteam.com/buy-then-sell/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** program, a new way to buy a house before selling your old one. **Here’s how it works:** First, we get you approved for a home loan so you can make a stronger offer on the house you love. We’ll even lend you the down payment on your new home; that means no worrying about having equity tied up in your old house.&nbsp;

Once you’ve purchased your new home, we advance you up to six months of mortgage payments on the old house so you’ll never have to pay two mortgages at the same time.&nbsp; Finally, we offer you up to $25,000 in prepaid home prep funds so you can sell your old house for top dollar. **With a dedicated support team, we’re there for you every step of the way** to ensure your house sells as quickly as possible. We’ve spent a lot of time improving the real estate experience to give you more certainty, convenience, and cost savings, and we believe that’s what makes our Buy Then Sell program the best possible way to buy and sell a home.&nbsp;

Find out more by contacting a Klaus Team agent by phone, email, or visiting our **[website](https://www.klausteam.com/)**. We’d be more than happy to answer your questions and get you on the path to a smooth transaction.
