What’s the latest news from our East Valley market?

Before we get to that, I want to make sure you’re receiving our newest technology: Homebot. Basically, Homebot is a personalized home valuation tool that can also estimate your equity position and do many other things. If you haven’t been able to use Homebot yet, please let us know, because it’s a great tool that we’ve gotten tremendous feedback about.&nbsp;

When it comes to our market, we’re in an interesting time. **There are fewer homes available than what we usually see, which makes now a great time to sell.** If you’re thinking about buying, the good news is that interest rates are still low. In fact, contrary to what was predicted at the end of last year, they’ve dropped even further.&nbsp;

If you’re considering buying a second home or an investment property, now is an especially great opportunity. Rent prices are increasing, and there’s a big shortage of available rentals.&nbsp;

We’re on top of all the latest developments in our market, so if you have any further questions or you need help buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
