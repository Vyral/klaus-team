There are a lot of renovation mistakes we tend to see homeowners make in our market, so today we’d like to list some big home improvement pitfalls to avoid and give you advice on what you should be doing instead.

**Here are some mistakes homeowners make:**

**1. Spending the money in the wrong places.** You want to ensure you receive a good return on your investment, but not all improvements will put money back in your pocket.

**2. Making uncommon improvements.** If your improvement isn’t exactly on most homeowners’ wishlists, it won’t do anything to make your home stand out on the market.

**3. Not calling us first.** You don’t have to be buying or selling, but planning big renovations without the advice of a professional agent is a great way to meet bad outcomes.

By speaking with experienced Realtors, such as those on our team, you can learn what improvements work the best in your market. **We can give you suggestions, provide you with homeowner workshops, and help you get the most for your dollar.**

If you’re thinking of selling in a few years, why not make the improvements now and enjoy them yourself for a while? You shouldn’t have to be making these renovations just so other people get to take advantage of them.

Give us a call and we can connect you with our great resources, help you find where your money is best spent, and keep you from making any home improvement mistakes. In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
