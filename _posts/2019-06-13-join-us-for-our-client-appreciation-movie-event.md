We can hardly contain our excitement because it’s that time of year again. What am I referring to? It’s The Klaus Team Client Appreciation Movie Event\!&nbsp;

On Saturday, July 20, we’ll all gather at Harkins Theatres Superstition Springs 25 to watch the digital remake of the 1994 Disney classic Lion King. The doors will open at 9:50. Be sure to get there early, get your drinks, popcorn, and candy, and settle in for some summer fun\! As a bonus, we’ll also be doing some giveaways beforehand.&nbsp;

We look forward to seeing you all there this summer\!
