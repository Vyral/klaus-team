I can’t believe we’re already a month and a half into 2019, but now that we are, it’s time to take a look back at what the beginning of this year has held for our market.

For one thing, the number of sales has dropped slightly from what we observed at this point last year, but activity does appear to be on its way up. Sellers shouldn’t despair, though. **It’s still a great time to list.** The only difference is that you will now need to be more careful in developing a competitive pricing strategy for your property.

There’s good news for buyers, too. **With increased inventory comes increased choice,** meaning you are more likely to find your perfect home now than would have been in the recent past. Also, as long as interest rates remain favorable, affordability will still remain comparatively high.

The bottom line is that we’re currently experiencing a strong, well-balanced market that favors buyers and sellers alike.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
