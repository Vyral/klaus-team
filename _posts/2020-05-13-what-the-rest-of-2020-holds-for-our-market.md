Now that we’re feeling the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, where is our real estate market headed from here? A lot of people are drawing comparisons to the Great Recession of 2008 and assume a housing crisis is imminent, but the facts say otherwise. For one thing, mortgage standards have changed for the better since 2008, and rent prices have increased significantly since then. While it’s true that we’re in the middle of a slowdown, we expect to finish 2020 on a strong note.
