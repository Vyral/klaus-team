Today, we’re excited to announce that we're blessed again this year to help some families here in our local community. For over the last five years, we've been helping four local elementary schools and connecting through social workers to find families that aren’t able to provide Christmas gifts for their kids. **This year, we’ll be able to help 84 kids, which is a record for us\!** If you would like to participate, we have two ways to do that.&nbsp;

First, you can donate, and we will take care of all the shopping and deliveries. You can do this by visiting our website [here](https://klausteamcares.org/). Secondly, **you can come to our wrap party and help out on December 10, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.** at a warehouse behind Costco, at 7235 E. Hampton Ave. STE 135. We'll have pizza at the end for everyone who volunteers.&nbsp;

We are very excited to extend this opportunity to you, as it’s a great way to give back to our wonderful community. Plus, this is one of the best times of the year and one of our favorite activities\! **We appreciate your continued support that makes this possible.** If you have any questions, call or email us anytime. Happy holidays\!
