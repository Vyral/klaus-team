On behalf of the entire Klaus Team, I wish you happy holidays\! Once again, thank you all for an amazing year. Despite all the chaos going on in our world, the real estate market has remained very steady, anchored by low interest rates and low inventory. We’re grateful for this resilient market, and we’re excited to be turning our attention toward making the holidays brighter for a few families in our community.&nbsp;

We are heading into the fifth year with our charity, Klaus Team Cares. For every person you refer and every home you buy or sell with us, we take a portion of that commission and donate it back to Klaus Team Cares, allowing us to then give back directly to local communities. This year we’re serving 24 families (84 total kids) that were brought to our attention as needing some assistance for Christmas.&nbsp;

We commissioned a group to do all of the shopping for these families, and we held a wrapping party last Saturday. **We’re ready to make this holiday season special for our neighbors who are experiencing hardship in these especially trying times.** Our effort to give back is merely an outpouring of our deep appreciation; we’re so thankful for your continued support and your referrals, which allow us to do so much good here in the local community.&nbsp;

For those of you who receive our local newsletter, you’ll be able to read about some additional ways that you can help us support our community. For example, you’re always welcome to drop off your nonperishable food donations at our office, Monday through Friday, and we’ll be sure to get it to our partners at the United Food Bank. Also, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Wednesday this month, we’ll be at the Fry’s in Guadalupe and Signal Butte ringing bells for the Salvation Army. **On Wednesday, December 9, the Klaus Team Cares charity will match any donation that is made to the Salvation Army.** Stop by and drop your donation in one of the kettles, or donate by visiting [klausteamcares.org](https://klausteamcares.org/).&nbsp;

Again, thank you for all that you do for us here at the Klaus Team. 2020 hasn’t been an easy year for most of us, but it's inspiring to see everyone pull together. People still need to buy and sell homes in our area, and we’re proud to serve not only them, but their friends and family as well. We look forward to an amazing 2021.

We have more specialized programs now than we’ve ever had before, including Buy First Then Sell, which has opened up possibilities for so many families. It allows you to buy and move into your new home first, then get your old home ready for market and sell for top dollar.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in learning more about any of the Klaus Team’s game-changing solutions for buying or selling in today’s market, please reach out via phone or email. **We’re always here to be of service,** and we look forward to hearing from you. Stay safe, and have a fantastic holiday season\!
